I have been plagued by kidney stones for the past 4 years, when I was diagnosed with innumerable kidney stones in both kidneys. In May 2018 I had surgery to remove 5 kidney stones that were embedded in my ureter. When I went back for follow-up, I still had blood in my urine, so more tests (ultrasound, CAT scan, KUB). Another stone; this one was 8 mm and also in my ureter. I was not in pain, but the location of the stone was causing my kidney to enlarge, so my doctor determined it would have to be removed and scheduled my surgery for 10/23/18.

The most I have had at one time is 8. Needless to say this condition has had a significant impact on my life. I can not work when I have multiple stones and the pain is beyond words. I have spent up to a month waiting for a stone to pass. Also I have had several surgeries to remove the stone/stones at a considerable expense. The recovery from a kidney stone operation is dreadful with lots of pain and bleading. A friend sent me an article on Chanca Piedra (Phyllanthus niruri). I immediately purchased some in a capsule form 500 mg. I take it three times a day. Since taking this herbal supplement I have not had any kidney stones, when in the past I would get at least one every two months. I highly recommend that people try this herbal supplement if they suffer from kidney stones. It can be purchased at most local herbal shops or on line.

The medication has been successful in relaxing the bladder neck muscle and prostate to allow the stone fragments to pass without pain. However, men should note the possible sexual side effects. I have experienced retrograde ejaculation. The initial sensation of orgasm feels pleasurable, but the intense pressure of seminal fluid collecting in the urethra before ejaculation doesn't happen. Instead, the relaxed muscles allow the semen to flow backward into the bladder. Ejaculation happens, but there is not a series of strong muscle contractions nor pleasurable feelings of release. I experience a few weak pulses and a few drops of semen (or none at all) ooze from my penis, even though my hips instinctively flex like a normal ejaculation. Fortunately, I've felt no discomfort when semen goes into the bladder, just a subtle feeling of congestion that is relieved later during urination. Overall, sexual satisfaction seems diminished by 50%. No issues with achieving an erection or responding to stimulation to reach the start of orgasm, but I've had to adjust to the physical and mental dissatisfaction with the lack of ejaculation.

-Dose they recommend: Daily max. 50 drops, or 1.31 g of extract (1310 mg)
-Dose I used: Started with 15-20 drops twice a day, reduced to 5-8 drops once a day.
-Reasons for taking the tincture: Hormonal imbalance, anxiety, insomnia, to boost the immune system.
-My experience so far: The first days I took about 15-20 drops twice a day. My anxiety seemed to worsten about an hour after taking the tincture, this would luckily slowly fade away but I did feel foggy, a bit numbed and depressed and nauseous throughout the day (I almost never get nauseous, so this was strange to me). Positive thing was that I did sleep like a baby but the downside was that I had a really hard time getting out of bed in the mornings. 
So after a few days I decided tot lower the dosage to about 10 drops twice a day. The foggy and numbed feeling stayed and made me feel insecure about my daily tasks so I decided to only take the tincture before bedtime. The deep sleep was wonderful, but I kept feeling so tired in the morning, it took me hours to feel a bit alert and I didn't like the light feeling of nausea that I remained as well, so again I lowered the dosage to only 5-8 drops once a day (before sleep). 
This seemed to work for me, as I was sleeping alright (not as deep as with the higher dosage though). I didn't feel nauseous, although it did still reduce my appetite and my anxiety and feelings of light depression would fade as well. I seemed to function fine during the day and my symptoms of PMS seemed to decrease. In general I felt good with this dosage. Especially because it seemed to balance my hormones (no mood swings, no swollen glands before my period, no increased susceptibility to allergy). 
In the description of this tincture it says to stop using it after three weeks. I decided to stop for 2-3 weeks (reducing the dosage to only 3 drops the last 3 days). After this pause I will start again with the dosage of max 8 drops a day before sleep and see how that goes. At this moment I have stopped taking the tincture for four days and didn't notice any big withdrawal symptoms. Although unfortunately I do have some trouble with sleeping again. Because there are so many warnings about this plant medicine, along with soms really bad experiences, I'm rather careful with using it.

I had the most random panic attack. I have not had panic attacks in YEARS! And then that's when I started noticing heightening anxiety now I do have anxiety, but this was different.

This was how I was that Monday though 4/19. I went to the ER because I didn't eat that week, I honestly felt like I was dying & my anxiety was the worse it's been like it was just 24/7 & intrusive at that point. The ER told me I was severely dehydrated & kept monitoring my heart. I tried to convince him that maybe this was just all anxiety related, but they disagreed. They were concerned about my stomach and the symptoms I was experiencing they had to put me on a few IV bags. They didn't want to release me, but they wanted to see how I felt at home after medicating me and putting me on the IVs. But they did tell me to stop the supplement! I didn't think anything of it at the time I was like it's a natural supplement shouldn't be an issue, but I was wrong.

People are as different as the colors of a rainbow. Everyone's experience will be different according to their personal chemistry and the things they eat and so on. So it was that I thought about trying this ashwagandha with an open mind, as it claims to reduce stress and improve sleep. Of course, coming to WebMD, I checked out what people were saying both positive and negative. I remembered people reporting that they would have strange dreams and suicidal thoughts.

So it was very disturbing to me that the very first time I used it to calm down after I had a rather stressful day, in the middle of the night I woke up having a rather vivid and unusual dream. After waking up but still in bed, I thought of what might happen if something terrible happened and my mind got around to thinking of suicide! I don't think that way, so it stood out in my mind and then I remembered the reviews of ashwagandha that reported these very same symptoms!

It was just too much of a coincidence for me to write it off.  Coming back here, my memory was verified. In my older years, I've been checking out various supplements. Some of them are quite good! But it's very few that comes with a warning about these things and I just wanted to add my name to a list of people having these symptoms. 

I'm not saying this product might not work for everyone. Everyone's chemistry is different and it's possible that there are people who might gain benefit from this. I'm not one of them! I'm simply not taking this again to find out if things ""smooth out"" or anything like that!

I took a powder from a health food store. Unfortunately it has taken me over a year to connect the dots and realize the ashwaghanda I incorporated into my natural treatments was then the culprit of some of the very symptoms I was trying to combat. Namely: low/no sex drive, being completely emotionally numb, extreme fatigue, debililtating brainfog. I will say it can lower anxiety, but along with this lowers my ability to feel any emotion at all and during acute stage I felt like a complete zombie, and had zero motivation. This affects so many hormones (is GABAergic, serotonergic, dopaminergic, affects your sex hormones, drastically lowers cortisol) The strong effect on all of this resulted in persistent and impactful imbalance eg: you really, really need cortisol..at the correct levels, to feel motivated and content emotionally) Yes I cycled it, and took half a teaspoon on the days I had it, a common recommendation. It wasn't til I restocked and commenced a new cycle nearly every day for 3 weeks (in January this year) that I noticed something was really, really wrong.. It does not work well with my, and many others' bodies. I have now been 2.5 months off so far and the extreme fatigue, brainfog, demotivation, and feeling dead inside have subsided (they were practically debilitating and I have lost a lot of my life to this supplement making me sick). I am becoming much more alert, my menstrual cycle is no longer extremely short like 21 days, I still can't feel all my emotions, nor is my sex drive working and that is significant, beyond having sex. Sexual energy is a life force, the feeling of embodiment. Whereas I am dissociated. I am 30 and know myself very, very well and this is distinctly an imbalance my body/brain are trying to recover from- my thoughts themselves are not negative. I literally can't feel my emotions. This really is not for everyone, please be careful and know that as an ayurvedic herb act very differently on each person depending on their energetic/biological make up and it would be best assessed and monitored by a qualified practitioner of herbal medicine.

I was interested in the stated results of reducing stress, anxiety, and increasing sexual function and testosterone support. I found Young Theory KSM-66 500mg capsules at my local Costco, though I had seen the Goji-brand gummies as well. I chose the capsule form as it better fits into my supplement routine. I would say it's been the better part of a year now, consuming most days out of the week on average, but aimed for daily consumption. I will say that I have noticed a pleasant increase in my libido, and certainly a reduction in my stress and anxiety, though not tremendous. I would consider this to be a supplement to mildly calm oneself through the day and help maintain a more level head. The best results I have seen in my time consuming is when I am stacking it with eating well most days out of the week, and occasional to regular exercise. I will add that I have not struggled with regular sickness as well, thanks to the added immune support. My only exception to this is when I became sick with COVID-19 at the height of the pandemic -- of course, I can't and won't speak to any of its effects with COVID-19 as there have not been any studies done as of today that can speak on its effectiveness to combat or prevent it. But in regard to the common cold, flu, etc, it has been incredibly effective at keeping me healthy day-to-day.
Reading some of the other reviews here, I've noticed an apparent trend that the folks that have taken Ashwagandha in gummy form have not had a great experience, so I'm unsure if different forms of the root have anything to do with its efficacy, but thought I would mention it if anyone can attest to this.
Ultimately, I have had a wonderful experience taking Ashwagandha and will continue to utilize it. My current primary form of consumption is through the BPN Super Greens powder, which contains 300mg of KSM-66 per serving, which is less than my average dose, but I do have the capsules with me in the event I feel as though I need to up my daily dose.

The stress level is immense and over the last couple of years, I gained quite a bit of weight.  I know that cortisol tends to send the fat to the belly so I thought I'd give this a try.  The label states that it helps maintain normal cortisol levels, among other things.  I started taking it about 6 months ago and the weight has been steadily coming off.  I am on a program of monitoring the kinds of foods I eat and being aware of what drives me to eat.  Combined, I have lost about 40 pounds.  I ran out a while back and decided to see if it was really doing anything for me.  After about two weeks off of it I noticed my weight plateaued, which is normal during weight loss.  I continued to eat as I had been and after another week, I noticed fat building up around my waist.  My weight was still sitting at the same measure and I started to think that maybe the pills were helping me with it.  So, I recently bought more and after a week my weight started moving down again and my waistline is getting better.  The weight loss is at a healthy rate of about half to 3/4 of a pound weekly and I feel better knowing my weight is moving down again, as well as my clothes fitting better.

From the label it contains: 380mg ashwagandha powder (root); 280mg ashwagandha extract (root); and 10mg ashwagandha supercritical CO2 extract. I read about ashwagandha as having a therapeutic effect on anxiety in a controlled study and I thought it might help me. It is also supposed to give energy and claims to have an effect on adrenal function. I have been previously diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder, and I suspect panic disorder as well. I am a 32 year old female at 120lbs, not on any medications, and I do not smoke, drink, or take illegal drugs. I followed the directions and took 1 caplet before food just before my dinner. I felt strange within just a few minutes, beginning with an unpleasant lightheaded sensation which startled me, and I began to feel panicky -- on a scale of 1 to 10, around a 7 or 8 in severity. It felt like I had drank about 3 or 4 cups of coffee at once. I am familiar with my anxiety levels and this was noticeably more intense. To be more precise I actually felt ""drugged."" It took 2 hours to come down from this feeling of panic with some deep breathing. I lost my appetite but I could still force myself to eat. It was a very uncomfortable experience for me. Currently, about 4 hours later, I still feel some effects -- slight but noticeable dizziness, very small headache, tense muscles in head and neck, tiredness, and mild anxiety. I'm amazed that an OTC supplement could have such a potent psychoactive effect; I was not expecting this at all, much less the opposite of the promised antianxiolytic effects. Everyone reacts differently to therapeutics, but I would seriously urge anyone interested in trying ashwagandha to start much smaller than the recommended dose, especially if you have anxiety disorders or are ""reactive"" by nature.

Miracle cure for last 5-6 months. This started to work for me after first few weeks, but did really notice huge difference for my wellbeing after 2 months. Increases the brain function, physical wellbeing, highly increased libido(in a woman,lovely orgasmic days), anxiety and stress reduction, but also night time insomnia and daytime drowsiness and fatigue. It does not take the anxiety away totally, but has made me able to manage quite well when nothing un-expected or stressful happens. During the usage I have noticed that my tolerance and resilience is only growing and I'm starting to trust that I can manage what ever happens. I do not feel that depressed anymore. It protects you from little daily stresses, but if something major happens it is not enough to cushion you from the impact fully. Which is super positive as nobody wants to become a zombie feeling nothing, but actually build more resilience and experiences. Like, 4 weeks ago something very stressful happened to me, my anxiety peaked up very high and found new forms of torment (shopping in Supermarkets started to become difficult and panic inducing + physical symptoms were becoming a norm). I thought that I needed to have some conventional mental medication and that Ashwaganda wasn't enough anymore. However I was too afraid to eat the mental meds, because my anxiety (+previous bad side-effects experiences). So it left me in just to increase my Ashwagandha intake to 2 capsules per day. It was too much and I got pretty bad nausea for a week. I went back to one capsule per day and I feel really good again! Did my 2 workdays very well and seems that I can manage again.

However, a year ago I began experiencing issues with peripheral vascular disease associated with varicose veins (ulcerations and subcutaneous bleeding on my calves, joint pain and stiffness, planar fasciitis and chronic leg cramps).     Within weeks of treating my varicose veins with compression stockings and elevation, I noted increased postural tachycardia, which became debilitating after 3 months (could no longer work). While waiting to see my PCP, I came off the melatonin and both my tachycardia and varicose veins began improving significantly. Three weeks after discontinuing its use, the tachycardia disappeared and the varicose veins improved enough to allow me to go without compressions stockings for intervals of several hours.    Have found nothing to explain the correlation but for a study in European Journal of Phramocology, vol 345, 1 March 1998 (NIH medical journal database), where the authors discuss the presence of MT1 & MT2 receptors (to which melatonin binds) in smooth muscle of vascular tissue and their role in vasodilation and constriction, respectively, as an explanation for melatonin's systemic efficacy.

Possibly even ""addictive"" (or cause a dependence); I'm tempted to take the ""good ones"" for afternoon naps!    But the problem is, each brand and dose of melatonin (and possibly each ""batch"") is SO different. A few brands have worked consistently better than prescription sleep aids for me, but unfortunately MOST brands are either ineffective, or produce the opposite effect desired (eg, I needed a Xanax to counteract the nervous, gittery feelings, then I still couldn't sleep but at least I wasn't jittery.)    One 3mg brand I like is pretty consistent for me (and $3/month! cheap!), but the same brand has a few other doses, plus a ""dissolvable"" 3mg dose with sweetening added, and of course all the bottles look the same, so I've accidentally bought the wrong ones (or if the right ones were sold out, tried another dose): ALL the other doses of the ""good brand"" didn't work. And the sugary one gave me the ""nervousness"" effect.    After a few YEARS of trying melatonin for sleep (on and off), though I have a decent one now, I really think the FDA should be looking at what these vitamin companies put into these pills. At least there should be consistency from ""batch to batch"" (same brand/dose).    So when you hit luck with a good one, it's very effective. But it really feels like a crapshoot when you open the next bottle. I'd love to put my brand/dose as 5-star satisfaction, but since this review is just ""melatonin"", I've got to consider the rest of my experiences with melatonin. Mostly positive, but even the few times I've gotten ""the jitters"" ...why package and sell a sleep aid that makes insomnia a nightmare?

Added 50 mg Bendryl (diphenhydramine)per night a few years ago and have not needed to change either dose since. I sleep through the night and wake up refreshed but sometimes a bit groggy. A good cardio workout takes care of that. Very important - try cutting down, or better, eliminating caffeine.   I've tried a number of brands of melatonin, but many don't work. I've settled on Natrol, because it works. There are probably others that work also, but I haven't seen any reason to experiment unless/until the Natrol becomes unavailable or stops working. Remember that these are not manufactured as drugs and there is no required test for what's in the tablet. If the first brand doesn't work for  you, try others until you find one. That doesn't mean you will necessarily succeed - melatonin doesn't work for everybody. Try it, though. Start with low doses and adjust as you see how it affects you.

Rather than put me to sleep it woke me up and gave me moe energy in the first few hours after taking it each night my dreams or rather My nightmares were much much more vivid  and memorable, before this i cannot remember having or at least remembering any dreams in the last 6 months. When I did sleep, every third day or so, my sleep was much shorter topping out between 3 and  hours. Then for the 2 days after I stopped taking it I slept about 21 hours a day and was extremely groggy when I was awake (afterwards, that is after the 2 day snooze fest, I returned to my normal insomnia problems.)But the worst side effect, reportedto me by family and coworker, was that while I kept taking the melatonin I was extremely irritable, easily annoyed and angered, not to mention so energized and thinking and talking a mile a minute most of the time when I had to be really alert for work, I guess to compensate my groginess (a sort of adrenaline rush of some kind and I imagine it was like some people feel when on speed or something, or immediately after coming off of it. It got so bad at one point that I was suspended for three days from my management job because I scared an employee and maybe even a few. Which is the exact opposite of what people usually tell me, i.e. I am usually so patient, happy, understanding, forgiving and helpfull.    Anyway, that was my experience of it.

The Nature's Design brand comes with 80% and already has the magnesium mixed in.     It does cause some constipation and slightly more frequent urination ( for me at least ), but I've not had anything majorly unpleasant as a result of taking it thus far. I would recommend it to others, but it's not likely something someone with ongoing stomach issues would be able to take without problems.     The blend I have supposedly helps with seratonin levels as well, which I've been calmer the past few days since taking and falling asleep a little easier. Not sure if it's placebo or the supplement. Considering that my job is being sent overseas and the recent anxiety I've had about it, it's been nice to feel more mellow about it.     My daily routine now includes a women's multivitamin, B complex, Zyrtec, and one GC supplement 20 to 40 minutes before my first meal. I have one usually 30 minutes before lunch, and will usually skip a third before dinner. But the instructions will call for more. So far 2 seems to be the safest medium I'm willing to take so far.

I started taking a product called Pro Garcinia and the main ingredient is Chromium Picolinate. This product intensified the effects of my depression immensely. I also suffered from many strong headaches while I was taking this supplement. I take 300 mg of Venlafaxine XR in the morning every day. This is the maximum recommended dosage and to get through the day to counteract the Pro Garcinia I had to take 3 x 150 mg capsules through out the day. I only had to do this for two days before I realized that there is something not normal in my routine.   I went online to research any side effects and I found that there is a side effect regarding people with depression.   I know it was a result of the Pro Garcinia because that is the only that has changed in my routine over that past week.   Because people do not understand what depression is all about and how it effects people, this has put a very severe crinkle n the relationship I just started with a new lady. My relationship is probably over because people do not understand.   I have written this review in hopes that other people will read it and realize the potential side effect this product has on those suffering with depression.   I strongly recommend that people research what they are about to take and how it may interact with their medication. What I went through was not fun.

Why take a supplement on top of that. Bottom line, it doesn't work unless you follow a strict regimen.

For those who claim to eat less & exercise more & not losing weight, it doesn't make sense because even if they are not using any supplements they should be losing weight by the mere fact that they are eating less & exercising more.  So they are either not being honest or not really watching their caloric intake. There are caloric intake calculators that will give you the amount of calories to consume in order to lose weight.

1546,Garcinia,WebMD,WebMD 2024,https://reviews.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientreview-818-GARCINIA,"Been taking 'Garcinia Trim 60%HCA' for almost a month now. The suggested use is one tablet(500MG) three times daily with full glass of water 60 minutes before each meal and not to exceed 6 tablets a day.      Pretty much I take one tablet around 8:10am, another at 10:30am-11:30am and sometimes I skip the third but if I do take it, I take it between 4pm-5pm.    So, this does help curb my appetite a lot. Days when I don't take it at all I find that my hunger pains are outrageous and in comparison, days I do take them I have no appetite nor hunger pains.    However, the mental 'fuzziness' i've seen in other reviews.. I've definitely experienced that. Some nausea/dizziness and on the verge of headaches. It's become pretty common towards later in the day but before I take third tablet. It sometimes feels like you can't concentrate/focus or that the light headedness makes it hard to perform basic stuff. I work in an office so usually i'm filing or at my computer. Being up on my feet and repeatedly bending over for files and such is not something I can do while one of these... 'episodes' persists(sensation of possibly passing out if moving too much). It's almost like your head is wanting to lull back(sometimes feels like 'the spins') or you can sometimes feel in your throat/chest area the sensation that you may want to vomit(never actually did). The chest/throat sensation... I can definitely see why others may perceive this as having troubles breathing.    Haven't noticed any sleeping issues although it may be because of the timing of when I take the tablets or lack thereof.      Conclusion: My full time job isn't very physically demanding so I can get away with dealing with the episodes that persist to an hour or two at most. While the side effects I have described may seem like enough to stop or pass on these, I have a high tolerance for pain/discomfort so against my better judgement I'll most likely continue to take these.",3.7,3,5,3,37,2,2013-09-04,19-24 | 1 to 6 months | Weight loss,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Garcinia Trim,,"mental fuzziness,nausea,dizziness,headaches",,,,,341,LLM

I followed the directions exactly, cut out all sugars, sweets, fried foods, milk and juice, and cut my meals to 3 times a day (less than 500 calories per meal) as well as working out 30 minutes of cardio morning and night (burpees, sit ups, jumping jacks and planks) and going to the gym for an 1 hour & 15 minutes 3 times a week (strength training, cardio and steamroom/sauna).

I have done workouts like this before and failed in loosing weight, but with the combination of my routine and Garcinia Cambogia i was able to fast track towards my goal. It is quite amazing to be from 309 pounds to 265 pounds. The trick to loosing weight isn't about just loosing pounds quickly, its a lifestyle choice that YOU want to make. I didn't even realize i lost so much until i touched down to California and looked in the mirror after a shower. The next day i went to Nordstroms and bought all new clothing because the clothing I bought was too big!!! lol . Still got a ways to go before i can fit into my size 36 jeans thats hangning on my wall!

The day it arrived I was going to go to the ER agian to be more miserable.. So I started taking it (in capsules, the tea made form made me sick) after taking the first 2 capsules 4 hrs apart the pain went away by 70% after the 3rd no more pain, the inflammation went down too. I selpt without pain that same night! The next day after taking 2 (4 hrs apart) and drinking tons of water, by 6pm I had the urgency to go pee (no pain) and BOOM! My stone came out caught it ! The relief I felt was priceless! I would check my urine with a urine dip stick that has 10 different tests and it would always show blood on it... After the stone came out it shows no more, that was in 2018. Chanca piedra really works!!! Helps get rid of infections too without the yeast infection antibiotics give you.

I've probably passed a hundred stones in my lifetime from the size of grain of sand to a small bullet. For the last ten years or so I generally did not have the agonizing pain associated with stones, but it was replaced with a dull ache that would linger for up to a month and would be triggered by any kind of physical activity. Even walking through the grocery store would set it off. I had a cat scan and it showed 'multiple' stones (generally meaning too many to count) and one very large one that was sitting right at the base of the kidney and potentially move around and block urinary flow. I was going to have lithotripsy again but the doctor was going to force me to have a stent which i don't need due to the size of the stones i've passed my whole life. I bought Stone Breaker off of Amazon and it has literally changed my life. I don't even take it every day, just when I start to feel any kind of burning, pain or any kind of disruption with my urine. I never passed any stone fragments and my urine did not appear cloudy as some of the reviews claimed. All I can say is that the lingering ache that plagued me for years is now gone. I can't believe it's a coincidence. Not sure if it changes the PH of my urine or what. I would be very curious to have another imaging of my kidneys done to see if that large stone is gone or has shrunk in size.
