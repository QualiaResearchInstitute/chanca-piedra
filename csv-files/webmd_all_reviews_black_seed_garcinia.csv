Went to doctor, took 2 prescriptions, had upper GI with no real culprit found.

Can look up on how to use for different types of illnesses, i got it from my Mom's reference book. Been using it for myself and family. My eldest was with asthma but not so chronic, and been giving him a bit of bsc oil mixed with daily syrup supplement, and thank God, he is now free from asthma. I myself used it for a number of times with cuts on my finger doing kitchen work, and using this oil can make the cut heal so fast, but need to beware of the pain it might cause in the beginning of treatment. I had used it when the cut is with quite unbearable pain, that the cut pain overcame the healing pain, and seriously, it heals faster than other healing oils/ointments i had used. I wouldn't recommend this to use for kids though. And there was once when i got severe stomache pain that i think might be gastric or some ulser, that i took the oil with honey, and yea, thank God that helped. I seldom get stomache ache. Was so hard to even move my body with the pain, but after taking it, after awhile i managed to move quite easily, not right after taking it of course. A mistake back then is i moved so fast when it felt ok, and the pain came back again, and again i took another dosage. The point is that it is healing the ulser/cut, but still need time for the cut to rest i suppose.",3,3

It worked well but the thing that surprised me the most was the overall improvement in asthmatic symptoms!!!!! I have moderate to severe chronic asthma and I have cut my asthma medication in half. In general I am diligent about taking my maintenance medication twice a day but with the addition of Black Seed Oil I was down to one puff 1 -2 times a day. My asthma was managed so well I often forgot to take my inhaler at night. Ran out of Black Seed Oil and noticed an increase in asthma symptoms at the 7th day. Only downside I have noticed is I burp black seed oil if I do not take it with food.,14,15

I wish I had weighed myself, as I didn't before hand, but I'll weigh myself and see where I am this weekend.   What I want to say to people is this: WebMD did not sell you the product that you have. WebMD simply wants to know what you think. They aren't customer Service. If you're having problems with whomever you purchased through ie auto shipping, money being withdrawn from your account etc, and they won't cancel or anything. Contact your bank and tell them it's a fraudulent charge and then contact the Better Business Bureau. If they are a legitimate company they will care about their BBB rating and cancel the auto-ship and refund you your money. Work with your bank. sometimes the auto-ship is explained and people forget to cancel or just weren't listening or didn't read the fine print. There is some consent involved. Also, don't put your personal information here for the world to see ie your phone number. Let's be smart people. I used to work for a company that sold vitamins and the business practices are not always above board, but also there is a responsibility on you as a consumer to be aware of the fine print, and all of the rules.     I will continue taking the product and see how I feel. Good luck to you all.",45,47

Specifically I've been taking the Nature's Design brand, which I found on Amazon after doing some research. I'd been on a reduced calorie diet that left me 10 lbs down, then 3 back up, and after that plateau I needed something to help. I did a good deal of digging before even buying because I'm more than aware of how gimmicky diet pills are...     Apparently you have to get the variety that is 50% of the active ingredient along with magnesium to get the most out of it. The Nature's Design brand comes with 80% and already has the magnesium mixed in.     It does cause some constipation and slightly more frequent urination ( for me at least ), but I've not had anything majorly unpleasant as a result of taking it thus far. I would recommend it to others, but it's not likely something someone with ongoing stomach issues would be able to take without problems.     The blend I have supposedly helps with seratonin levels as well, which I've been calmer the past few days since taking and falling asleep a little easier. Not sure if it's placebo or the supplement. Considering that my job is being sent overseas and the recent anxiety I've had about it, it's been nice to feel more mellow about it.     My daily routine now includes a women's multivitamin, B complex, Zyrtec, and one GC supplement 20 to 40 minutes before my first meal. I have one usually 30 minutes before lunch, and will usually skip a third before dinner. But the instructions will call for more. So far 2 seems to be the safest medium I'm willing to take so far.

I started taking a product called Pro Garcinia and the main ingredient is Chromium Picolinate. This product intensified the effects of my depression immensely. I also suffered from many strong headaches while I was taking this supplement. I take 300 mg of Venlafaxine XR in the morning every day. This is the maximum recommended dosage and to get through the day to counteract the Pro Garcinia I had to take 3 x 150 mg capsules through out the day. I only had to do this for two days before I realized that there is something not normal in my routine.   I went online to research any side effects and I found that there is a side effect regarding people with depression.   I know it was a result of the Pro Garcinia because that is the only that has changed in my routine over that past week.   Because people do not understand what depression is all about and how it effects people, this has put a very severe crinkle n the relationship I just started with a new lady. My relationship is probably over because people do not understand.   I have written this review in hopes that other people will read it and realize the potential side effect this product has on those suffering with depression.   I strongly recommend that people research what they are about to take and how it may interact with their medication. What I went through was not fun.

She actually told me to not eat broccoli or any grains. I was a bit stunned to hear that. So I started questioning in my mind, what is the point if all this. Why take this supplement when they're advising to basically follow a low carb diet, which by itself can result in weight loss. Why take a supplement on top of that. Bottom line, it doesn't work unless you follow a strict regimen. You just simply have to decide to stop eating any processed crap, exercise regularly and don't expect the lbs to come off so quickly, be patient and stick with it.

So indeed it has reduced my appetite significantly. I eat a healthy diet, lots of lean meat, fruits, green veg, and healthy fats. I still love to eat and eat at a restaurant daily ... but make great choices in what to eat there. I actually crave vegetables in ways most obese crave junk food/sweets/unhealthy fats.

I did try for a while at a higher dose and did feel uncomfortable with that, so stopped. I think the full does, not more, not less is best. I know it doesn't work for everyone.

The effects were needing to drink water all the time, it did stop me from getting hungry, no change in my energy levels and I was very curious if I would put the weight back on.  I stopped using it for 3 weeks, during that time I was on a craving buzz for anything sweet, chocolate etc.  I put this down to emotional eating? So I decided to go back on and try a different brand.  This brand has made me wanting to urinate frequently, dry mouth and not so hungry, as well as lack of appetite.  Still not so energetic too.

They also interrupted the weight loss program because they shipped my next order at least 10 days after I took my last pills. How can you keep with a program if the very company that's supposed to be aiding you is hindering that process.  They then told me that I could get a tea which they offered for free.  They said this would aid in the weight loss process and suggested it was very effective.  If this is the case why not just send it to begin with?    I had high hopes for this product working but it proved to be very ineffective for me.  Good luck to those of you lucky enough to have this work for you.    Still Overweight!,5,6

When I received the bottle of pills it came with directions about exercising and watching what I eat, so I didn't have much faith it it and didn't even open for over a month. Then came another bottle in the mail with a receipt where they deducted $86.00 from my checking account. About that time I got a horrible case of the flue/cold. After about two weeks of sickness I had lost 10 lbs. So after I started to recover I thought well as long as I've paid $93.00 for two bottles of pills I might as well take them. I took 3 pills a day as directed, and ate as I felt like eating. My only exercising is walking to the mail box, and the refrigerator. a couple of weeks later I weigh myself and found I had lost another five lbs. I still wasn't sure it was from the pills, but two weeks later I had lost another four pounds without ever changing the way I ate. After another week on the pills and I had lost another 2 pounds, and that's where I am now. Even though I feel that I was bamboozled with the price; loosing 13 pounds in six weeks without dieting, plus the 10 pounds previously made 23 pounds that I have lost, and I feel great.

I have not felt this bad in a very long time. I couldn't concentrate and was trying to write something and could not spell even my name correctly. Grateful for spell check on here. I am confused and dizzy to the point of passing out and my eyesight keeps going black and then fuzzy. I feel like I have been run over by a Mac truck. Also, my sugar is always normal and it was 168 for no apparent reason (I only checked it because I felt so bad I thought it might be low). I do not recommend this product to anyone. Nothing else in my diet or medications has changed which is why I know that this product has to be the cause of all these problems. Also, I had no change for the better in energy levels or appetite control. I had been taking ACE and it was working great, I was hoping this would work as well because the price is so much cheaper, but I am going back to my ACE pills that don't make me sick and help with appetite control and energy increase without any bad side effects. Truly, if you want a pill to help with your diet and exercise program I recommend ACE. It works. I have lost 20 ponds in 1 month with them. ",17,18

They would lure customers in with a free trial only to then charge you $80 two weeks later if u didn't cancel and return that same bottle they gave u for the free trial. It makes no sense. If they were actually confident about their product they would offer a 'real' free trial and have faith the customer would re order their product if they saw results. The way they conduct their business is sneaky and dishonest. I highly recommend not to waste your time or money. ,28,29

Dr. Oz claims you don't have to diet or exercise but I'm not sure if that would work.  I started eatng less calories & I exercise 20 minutes/day, 3x per week. I did notice that the garcinia cambogia does supress my appetite and it actually helps me stay regular.  It also has serotonin which helps emotional eaters.  For those who claim to eat less & exercise more & not losing weight, it doesn't make sense because even if they are not using any supplements they should be losing weight by the mere fact that they are eating less & exercising more.  So they are either not being honest or not really watching their caloric intake. There are caloric intake calculators that will give you the amount of calories to consume in order to lose weight.  The Garcinia Cambogia helps to suppress appetite & lose fat.  According to Dr. Oz, your scale may show an increase due to muscle gain so make sure you try on clothes or take your measurements.

Two symptoms I noticed were that It was harder to pass bowels, normally I would do so every other day but while taking GC it was very hard and came more infrequently. The other side effect that I noticed were very extreme menstrual cramps, I have never had bad cramps before I would maybe take one Ibuprofen on the first day and that was it, but while taking GC I had three very bad periods, my cramps were so extreme each time that I was literally sick and vomiting because the cramps were effecting my entire body.

In fact, they could care less. I have been off of this now for almost 3 months, but I had to use skin supplements to bring the color back to my ski.

I've read a few reviews regarding a garcinia cambogia 1600 from mncpremium, and that's where I started looking at garcinia due to the oversize serving - I prefer ""to the max"" when it comes to all things health.    Is it easy to use? Absolutely.  A couple capsules a day is easy to take about an hour before I could eat.  Does it work?  I normally have a giant appetite because I'm a fairly active guy.  It does seem to curb that as long as I stay consistent with it - at 3-4 pills a day is 2400-3200mg, which again is the high end of recommended dosages.    Am I satisfied?  I wasn't expecting miracles, so I'm fairly satisfied.  I'm anxious to try a yacon extract as an overall healthier alternative based on the clinical research.  I just re-ordered garcinia cambogia 1600 so I'll give that another ~3 weeks to try, then I'll give their yacon exract a shot.

Fiber will cause bloating, gas, fluid retention, cramps in some folks. Those folks probably need to forget the garcinia and do the colon cleanse, gently, to remover their blockages. There are a lot of cheaper fiber products out there.  I wonder if some companies are sneaking other known weight loss substances in that are no longer recommended because they do cause heart trouble or maybe just a lot of caffeine?  Although I like ""going"" every day, at $50 a bottle, I can do without.  Please be careful out there everyone, remember the fen-fen craze and resulting deaths and heart damage?

Long story short; this product can cause severe acid reflux and at times, the capsule doesn't dissolve fast enough causing it to be settled in the esophagus area. I always drank a ton of water after taking the capsules but this still happened.

After seeing it over and over on fb and talking to many customers that have called me to dispute charges on their credit card account (I work for a bank) I did some research myself. I looked at so many websites that offer this and always checked the TERMS link at the BOTTOM of the page. I seen that almost all of the websites offering this for a low 4.95 for shipping clearly say in their terms and conditions that YOU WILL be on a monthly renewal after 14 to 18 days and will not be able to cancel it until you have received a 3 month auto shipment of this product at a mere 79.99 a month I decided to order from amazon. After all there is no monthly renewal or extra info to search for on their website. I found a product that has 180 pills for just 21.99 was shipped and received within 2 business days per amazon prime (in which I also read the terms and conditions and am fully a wear that by giving them my cc# I will be charged 79.00 a year) I am so far happy with the product. I have only been on it for 2 days and feel pretty good. As far as weight loss I have no clue yet to attest to if it works or not. But I have not been as hungry and feel pretty good as far as not be to tired after working 11 hours today. We will just have to wait and see how it works for me. Im just happy I know how to navigate web pages and have enough smarts to look into what Im signing up for before I give all my info to some so called great offer. I hope that what anyone and everyone takes from this remark is to take the time to review what your signing up for and don't be surprised if you don't do your reached that you might get taken for a whole lot more then the so called 4.95 shipping and handling. ,71,78

I felt queasy and I did lose some weight.I was losing approx. 1 lb per day but the diarrhea and queasiness makes this un acceptable for me. My main issue came with the fact that the online avenues tried to suck you into a monthly program. When I called to cancel my 15 day trial period They tried to make me ship back the extra they sent at my expence. They spouted off about the terms and conditions but I let them know that I didn't buy anything other than pay shipping for a free trial and that if they wanted the product they would need to send me the prepaid shipping label and box to return it with as the terms and conditions only mentions returns for refunds. The guy then cancelled both trials with confirmations and said that if I were unwilling to ship back at my own expense that there was nothing they could do. Don't get sucked in.

I started out at 285 pounds. At first I did the HCG diet which dropped the weight rapidly, but was such a strict diet, I found it hard to stick with and some of the weight quite often returned. After several rounds of the HCG, I tried Raspberry Keytones and then the Garcinia. The Garcinia was much more effective. I am now just under 200 pounds and am feeling so much healthier.

I've had heart problems in the past, and I'm really surprised to see people saying they had heart rate increase, especially since there are no stimulants in any of the products I've seen.  I lost 3 pounds this week, which is a lot for me, considering I hadn't lost any in about 3 months. I'm pretty pleased with my results.  People need to remember that every supplement works differently for everyone, and there can be allergic reactions.  It's not a cure all for obesity, but I'll continue to take it until I reach my goal!",44,45

Before you take anything you must make sure you are in good health most people do not check with their docs 1st and you MUST do that. You have to take the colon cleanse so you can have a bm every day and not get backed up. It works people need to stop eating unhealthy to also this is not an overnight pill PEOPLE where you will just loose 50 lbs.

Garcinia,WaryButReckless,19-24,1 to 6 months,Weight loss,2013-09-04,3.6666666666666665,3,5,3,"Been taking 'Garcinia Trim 60%HCA' for almost a month now. The suggested use is one tablet(500MG) three times daily with full glass of water 60 minutes before each meal and not to exceed 6 tablets a day.      Pretty much I take one tablet around 8:10am, another at 10:30am-11:30am and sometimes I skip the third but if I do take it, I take it between 4pm-5pm.    So, this does help curb my appetite a lot. Days when I don't take it at all I find that my hunger pains are outrageous and in comparison, days I do take them I have no appetite nor hunger pains.    However, the mental 'fuzziness' i've seen in other reviews.. I've definitely experienced that. Some nausea/dizziness and on the verge of headaches. It's become pretty common towards later in the day but before I take third tablet. It sometimes feels like you can't concentrate/focus or that the light headedness makes it hard to perform basic stuff. I work in an office so usually i'm filing or at my computer. Being up on my feet and repeatedly bending over for files and such is not something I can do while one of these... 'episodes' persists(sensation of possibly passing out if moving too much). It's almost like your head is wanting to lull back(sometimes feels like 'the spins') or you can sometimes feel in your throat/chest area the sensation that you may want to vomit(never actually did). The chest/throat sensation... I can definitely see why others may perceive this as having troubles breathing.    Haven't noticed any sleeping issues although it may be because of the timing of when I take the tablets or lack thereof.      Conclusion: My full time job isn't very physically demanding so I can get away with dealing with the episodes that persist to an hour or two at most. While the side effects I have described may seem like enough to stop or pass on these, I have a high tolerance for pain/discomfort so against my better judgement I'll most likely continue to take these.",37,39

I like Garcinia Cambogia because its an ALL NATURAL SUPPLEMENT (not a miracle pill). By taking this pill, i had to work out and change my diet to make this fully effective. I followed the directions exactly, cut out all sugars, sweets, fried foods, milk and juice, and cut my meals to 3 times a day (less than 500 calories per meal) as well as working out 30 minutes of cardio morning and night (burpees, sit ups, jumping jacks and planks) and going to the gym for an 1 hour & 15 minutes 3 times a week (strength training, cardio and steamroom/sauna). I had a goal sheet from a tight size 46 to a size 36, within two months i was able to fit comfortably into a size 40 waist (and squeeze into a size 38), just in time for my vacation to California! I have done workouts like this before and failed in loosing weight, but with the combination of my routine and Garcinia Cambogia i was able to fast track towards my goal. It is quite amazing to be from 309 pounds to 265 pounds. The trick to loosing weight isn't about just loosing pounds quickly, its a lifestyle choice that YOU want to make. I didn't even realize i lost so much until i touched down to California and looked in the mirror after a shower. The next day i went to Nordstroms and bought all new clothing because the clothing I bought was too big!!! lol . Still got a ways to go before i can fit into my size 36 jeans thats hangning on my wall! To make a long story short, i recommend Garcinia Cambogia, but check with your doctor first if your a diabetic.
