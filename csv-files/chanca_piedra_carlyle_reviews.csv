But the stuff tastes like bile or stomach acid. It is so foul. Not sure why I didnâ€™t think to check for s pill version, but glad I found it. So far this brand has done its job well and I plan to take as part of my regular supplements and hopefully prevent future stones.",16 people found this helpful,
Chanca piedra,Carlyle Chanca Piedra,Matthew Sullivan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2023",false,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been dealing with galbadder issues for at least 10 years now.  It finally got to a point that I knew I would need to do something, which would likely be getting my galbladder removed.  After researching, I discovered many people still complain of pains even after removing their galbladder.  A sarastic ""wonderful"" came to mind.  After learning about Chanca Piedra, I had to give it a try.I never saw the results that some people saw within a few days or weeks, but I stuck with my daily regimen, which I had decided on: 4 capsules 30 mins after lunch and 4 more 30 mins after dinner (as well cutting out ALL soft drinks, with the occasional one every 6-7 days).  I began on January 24 and at the time of this writing during the first week of March, I have ZERO pains in my stomach near the area of my galbladder.  I do have some slight pain in my right shoulder that began 2-3 weeks prior to this review, but it is starting to subside (which I would guess/attribute to stones moving through duct and some accompanying inflammation) .  More importantly - I am head-over-heels that I feel no stomach pain!!!If you are dealing with galbladder issues, this can't hurt.  Try it for at least 1-3 months if you don't get instant relief.  I will likely start to cut back on my dosage, but I will continue to use this stuff!  I had my doubts, but glad I stuck with it!!!!",5 people found this helpful,
