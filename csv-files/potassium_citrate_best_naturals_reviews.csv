Potassium citrate,Best Naturals Potassium Citrate,Frenchfry,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2022",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"You can really get confused knowing which type of potassium to take.  I decided on this type because experts said it is alkaline and helps to prevent kidney stones.  O.K.  All I can say is, it works.  Along with calcium, it seems to prevent cramps in my feet or calves.  I'll take that in a heartbeat.",2 people found this helpful,
