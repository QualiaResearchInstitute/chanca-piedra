Chanca piedra,Alerna: Chanca Piedra 500mg,Midwest_Meanderer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2024",true,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Having had kidney stones in the past, I've purchased and come to rely on Chanca Piedra tablets from Alerna for a few years now, as they were the best, IMO, Chanca Piedra product available—they worked, period. I've been their biggest cheerleader, always directing others with kidney stones to their product. However, when I went to reorder recently, I could not find the 1000 mg tablets they've carried in the past, so I contacted the company directly and was told that they no longer carry or make the 1000 mg tabs, only a 500 mg powder-filled capsule now instead. I ordered the 500 mg, but am very disappointed as they are no match for the tablets, even when doubling the dose. Luckily, I found another company that makes CP tablets at a higher dose, so I've switched with good results. ALERNA, if you see this, remember the old adage: if it ain't broke, don't fix it.",One person found this helpful,

Chanca piedra,Alerna: Chanca Piedra 500mg,Alan Asher,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 20, 2020",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"TL;DR It works and I am kicking myself for not continuing my maintenance of a pill a day for a year.I have had kidney stones practically my entire adult life, producing one every 4 to 6 months. 3 years ago my pattern changed tho. It switched from my left kidney to my right and after it switched sides, I only produced a single stone the first time then the pain of passing a stone was occurring every few weeks. After a while I would produce bloody urine frequently and I finally got a CT scan to confirm what I feared. a 2cm stone was in my right kidney. The nephrologist said ""your kidney is functioning in normal levels"" so they didn't suggest doing anything about it and I'm seriously dumbfounded, because of the amount of pain I was in. Pain makes us think differently, My next step was to figure out a way to make a DIY lithotripsy machine. Luckily I found the stonebreaker chanca piedra. Within a month I was back to feeling normal and I decided to take a bottle's worth of 1 pill a day as maintenance. I ran out and felt fine so I didn't get a new bottle. 1 year later, I bought another bottle as I passed a small stone.This stuff truly is amazing. It works at least for the uric acid based stones which is what I produced.",11 people found this helpful,

Before that he had many bouts of painful kidney stones. After one of these episodes ruined our Hawaii vacation (it was so painful, and we spent more than our vacation costs on our portion of the emergency room visit), we began to look for more help than his urologist would provide.We found the ingredient in these pills from a different source in the beginning, but soon settled on these. They have been so effective and easy for him to take. He has not had a single bout of kidney stones since taking this product.

(If I had a dollar for every time someone told me to try yoga for one of my lifelong illnesses, I would have enough money to retire at 32.) However, I also recently added kidney stones to my long list of ailments - they run in my family - and a friend who also suffers INSTANTLY told me to grab this stuff.After weeks of gritting my teeth through the pain and only passing sediment, I gave in and ordered. I took two a day for a week. And then I painlessly passed a stone. WHAT. SERIOUSLY? WHAT???I've had one flare-up of kidney pain since, took another week course of two pills a day, and passed a bunch of crumbly bits. I'm a believer now.

Chanca piedra,Alerna: Chanca Piedra 500mg,njm0923,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2018",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I suffer from a kidney stone disorder called MSK and for years I've looked for something, anything, that could help break down the stones and help them pass easier. I've altered my diet, take suppliments and drink enough water to fill a swimming pool but nothing seemed to help me as much as Chanca Piedra. I happened to stumble upon an article about it and thought I'd give it a try. After going through a few different, pricier, brands I finally found the Alerna brand. This is straight Chanca Piedra. No mixes, no fillers nothing extra to get in the way or give the manufacturer an excuse to charge a ridiculous made up price for something that doesn't work. I've been taking it now for a few months and have noticed a distinct difference in my kidney stone output as well as the way my body handles dealing with a passing stone. They nickname this stuff the ""stonecrusher"" and from what I've seen the shoe fits. Imagine going to the restroom to urinate and peeing out what appears to be a powdered version of what you normally contend with. For the first time cloudy urine didn't mean I had a UTI. It meant my body was flushing out pulverized kidney stone! If you deal with kidney stones at all I believe this product may be beneficial for you. And for the price it's way more affordable then multiple costly trips to the urologist only to be told, ""It looks like you have a kidney stone."" Brilliant!",21 people found this helpful,
