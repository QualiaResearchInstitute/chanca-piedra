Chanca piedra,CNP Organic Chanca Piedra Concentrate & Extract,Art S,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2024",true,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I followed the directions and diluted two tbsp in a glass of iced water.  After about 30 minutes, it felt like my stomach was ON FIRE.  That 'fired-up' feeling was very painful and lasted for about 3 to 4 hours.  I drank more cold liquid which did seem to reduce the pain level.  I passed a kidney stone a few days later which emerged looking black and looked like it had been burned (could be a coincidence).  I can't say for sure that the Chanca Piedra Concentrate had any effect on assisting me to pass the stone.  I can say that since it was such a painful experience, I'm NOT planning on using the product in the future.  Good luck.",12 people found this helpful,Size: 8 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)
Chanca piedra,CNP Organic Chanca Piedra Concentrate & Extract,Jennifer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2024",true,1.0 out of 5 stars,"mightve reacted with thiazide which many kidney stone patients take, webmd says it is a known interaction; could not return. Only  medicine I take. Very terrifying, please do not buy until FDA looks at this stuff. ugh,from google gemini: Yes, it absolutely makes sense that you experienced dizziness and heart racing after taking chanca piedra while also being on hydrochlorothiazide (thiazides). Here's why:Additive blood pressure effects: Both chanca piedra and hydrochlorothiazide can lower blood pressure. Taking them together can lead to a more significant drop than intended, potentially causing dizziness and lightheadedness.Electrolyte imbalance: Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic that can cause the body to lose electrolytes, particularly potassium. Chanca piedra might further contribute to this imbalance. Electrolyte imbalances can affect heart rhythm and lead to heart palpitations.It's important to stop taking chanca piedra immediately.  The dizziness and heart racing you experienced are signs that these substances might be interacting negatively in your body.",8 people found this helpful,Size: 16 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)
Chanca piedra,CNP Organic Chanca Piedra Concentrate & Extract,Matthew V,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2023",true,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been taking various chanca piedra concentrates for kidney stones for the past year or so. I ran out just as a stone was starting to give me pain. I got this one thinking it was a good deal - blame my pain and desire to get it ASAP, but I didn't check the serving size. This is actually not a very good deal, cost-wise. It's very diluted. Because there's no information about how much chanca piedra is actually in here, I have doubts that it's much at all. The rosemary is overpowering taste and smell-wise, so I can't tell if the chanca piedra taste/smell is present at all. I've been taking this as directed for about a week now, and the past two days have been AWFUL pain-wise, leading me to believe this isn't doing nearly as much as other extracts I've tried. Overall, I can't say whether or not this is what it says it is, but I have serious doubts.",8 people found this helpful,Size: 16 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)

Chanca piedra,CNP Organic Chanca Piedra Concentrate & Extract,Cyndi M,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2023",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Since I started getting Kidney Stone (5 years ago) I've been using this to combat it.  I mix one ounce of this with one ounce of Black Cherry Concentrate (Tart is Smart is best) and 10 ounces of Sprite.  Tastes just like a Cherry Soda.  I drink it once a week for maintenance and have had absolutely no episodes since.  The first week (sometimes 2 weeks) you drink it daily after that, you go on the maintenance plan.  It's quite easy and so much better than for you (and cheaper) than taking the prescriptions they want you to take.  The reason I say Tart is Smart is better is because it is a much heavier concentrate than what's out on the market now.  However, since Tart is Smart is only made in season, you need to make sure you have enough of it to keep you supplied through the non-seasonal months so stock up on it.  Once you're in maintenance, a 16 oz bottle of it will last you 16 weeks.",46 people found this helpful,Size: 16 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)

It seemed to help. I don’t remember having a gallbladder attack when i was taking it. It didn’t seem to be doing much by half the bottle was gone, so I chugged the rest. I took one good poop, and who knows if it cleared or dissolved any gallstones because I wasn’t about to dig through my poop to find out. I think next time, I am either going to take it the same way as before, take half the bottle as directed and then chug the rest, or I will buy some chanca piedra that is more potent. But who knows in this market if I’m even getting the right thing. It seemed diluted and I did feel something going on in my gallbladder when I first took it.

At first, I was having to do doses for about a 2 weeks (I had 3 rather large stones), then to once every 3 days and then 1 day a week for maintenance.  I mix one ounce of each in Sprite (tastes better than using water-kind of like a cherry cola).  Stones had completely dissolved and I haven't had any more.  I've been doing this for 4 years now.  I found it also worked for gout because I haven't had any episodes of that during the same time period.

Chanca piedra,CNP Organic Chanca Piedra Concentrate & Extract,Timothy Lawson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2021",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had problems with kidneystones for years, this last year was the worst. My last lithotripsy was a few months ago in September for a 1.3 centimeter stone. My last xray was clear, but the CT scan showed alot of fragments still in that kidney. I decided to try chanca piedra and started taking it. It was a different brand in pill form. I took it daily from that time for 3 months and it didn't help move out any additional stones. I didnt want more buildup back to a large stone again, so I decided to try this brand in liquid form instead. Ive been taking it once a week for about a month. On Thursday I felt a sharp pain in my right side just for a few minutes. I knew a stone was coming down the ureter. I came home and took a dose of this. This morning, I unknowingly passed 2 small stones. The stones were soft and disintegrated when I touched them with a Q-tip. They did not have the hard sharp edges that my prior ones did. I had no pain at all and didn't even know I had passed them! I can't believe it softened them that much! I know i have more, so I just ordered another bottle. I am going to take it daily instead of weekly. This liquid form works so much better than the pill form in other brands. I am going to continue taking this to try to move it all out and as a preventative after that. People need to have patience, sometimes this doesn't work overnight and sometimes it literally does. Some stones are more stubborn with higher or different mineral compositions and crystal concentration. One thing I promise it does, it 100% softens them and makes them much less painful as they pass from the kidneys to the bladder because the sharp edges are gone! I highly recommend giving this a try if you suffer from them like I have!",226 people found this helpful,Size: 16 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)
