I decided to try Chanca Piedra tea instead of the capsules and drops I had been using.  Hanan is the brand I chose and have been using it for a couple of years on and off whenever noticing symptoms.  I was quite satisfied with this product until my last order, a single box of 25 tea bags.  I usually buy three boxes but couldn't afford to do so this time.  I was very disturbed to discover that nearly half the tea bags in this latest purchase had barely any product in them!!!  This has never happened before.  Naturally, I went through the box much faster than expected.  I'm a 70 year-old retired senior on a lower income.  At $12 per box, I feel I was ripped off and will purchasing from another seller going forward.",5 people found this helpful,Size: 25 Count (Pack of 1)

I do not know if I received a faulty batch , but 80% of my tea bags open up while I'm pouring tea! The quality of the bag is really bad! You are paying 12usd for tea and you cannot use 80% of the bags because they open up while you are pouring, or even worse they are open already before you start pouring. So you end up with hot water and the herb inside your tea, instead of actually having a useful tea bag.

Thanks! Lol! Whatever! I’m in pain. I don’t care.I took this tea, 2 bags steeped for 5 minutes in one cup about 25 minutes ago!At emergency I was told I have one 6mm stone that just left the kidney.Yesterday, I got another x-ray to see if it moved, but my doctor apparently is too busy to read it and tell me the results for 3 days. Maybe more. Too busy I guess.The x-ray tech and I clearly see 2 stones. One in kidney and one in the bladder? Did it break? Did they not see one in the CT scan. The urologist hasn’t told me, because he apparently is too busy.My bladder is totally reacting to this! I never heard so many noises in my bladder.I’m scared, but I don’t trust the Dr. and he has never even had a stone. He couldn’t care less. I trust the actual results of people who have taken this more than I trust him. I trust these reviews more than I trust him, because he doesn’t care.I was in emergency 8 days ago in the most excruciating pain of my life. They helped me and gave me the medications listed. I hope it’s okay to take this tea with those medications. I’m also taking:Flomax/TamsulosinNaproxen 500 mgHydrocodone-AcetaminI 100% feel my kidney is now making noises since I drank this tea! It’s such a weird feeling. I will update you soon. We will see… I kind of feel like drinking more! This is DEFINITELY doing something because I can actually hear it and feel it!!!————UPDATE————12/29/2023I cannot even express how grateful I am to God that this tea saved me from the worst pain of my life, along with medication listed above. I no longer feel pain and I will eventually go back and get another x-ray, but I need a break from Dr. now. I also got a better urologist that does not ignore me. I love this tea and drink it daily.

I’ve been in the emergency room four times, and a week ago my kidney decided to let loose the largest kidney stone I’ve ever had. The CT scan measured it at 5.2 mm, and my doctor said if I didn’t pass it in a week I needed to schedule lithotripsy. He didn’t think I could do it myself. I have been doing everything. I’ve been taking herbs, drinking water and coconut water, taking homeopathy, etc. I’ve taken Chanca Piedra in various forms for years, including capsules and tinctures. In a moment of desperation, I ordered this tea. It arrived yesterday afternoon, and I had one mug full of it. Immediately, I noticed a very relaxing feeling come over me and the pain decreased a little bit. I felt more myself last night than I have in the past week, and I finally felt hope that I would be ok. About 24 hours later, I painlessly peed this stone out. You can’t tell from the pictures, but it is smaller than the 5.2 mm the hospital said it was. It’s also smooth (I’ve passed several that had huge teeth). I doubt this tea is solely responsible for me passing the stone, but I know it played a huge part.

The thought of having surgery made me scared. I look you up diy remedies. I had seen online to drink warm pressed apple juice and lay on your right side to help with pain/discomfort which helped other flareups but on this particular day nothing was working and this was by far the worst pain I ever felt where I figure something in my stomach was ready to explode. I came across this tea, in desperate need from being discomfort I decided to order it and give it a try. Some reviews said they took the tea twice a day so that’s what I did. I drank a tea first thing in the morning and one at night before bed.First day of drinking the tea I notice the pain/ discomfort was gone. Second day I notice my bloat was gone, still in no pain. On the third day I finally passed a stone which I didn’t even feel. I also still feel like I never had any stomach pain issues.

I was having a big gallbladder pains. I've been having gallbladder problems for 5 years and they never remove it in the ER. So i was having a flare. I can always tell when it's enlarged and full of stones and slugde. I bought this because I read good reviews. Thinking it wasn't gonna work and i was gonna end up in the ER again. so as soon as I receive it, it soon began. I can feel it getting angry and angrier. I was in so much pain. By this time I wasn't eating anything. So middle of the day came and i had another 2 tea bags, oh boy it got angrier. Then night came and i had 2 more tea bags (always drink it really hot and no sugar or anything else on it). By the night i was in agony. I was crying and in labour with stones. One after another after another. So the next morning i had 1 tea bag. It kept going. I can still feel it's large and angry. I kept drinking 1 tea bag 3 times a day despite being in agonizing pain. I was crying and just wanted to stop. But I pushed through. Finally the pain of stone passing stopped. But it wasn't over, i still have a large gallbladder filled with sludge. Now that had to come out. We are 3 days in and i kept drinking the tea (3 times a day). But the sludge was only coming out slowly. Finally 7 days later my gallbladder is empty and back to normal. Avoided a trip to the ER and surgery. Thanks.Edit: what I went through is not for everybody. It was a battle at home. I did everything while on a liquid diet no sugars or solids as well as nothing greasy. It has been years and still no pain and no stones and I eat healthy but back to normal.

Drink the tea after steeping for 5 min. Have a pain pill on hand. A real pain pill not Excedrine etc.  In 20 min or so you will feel an uncomfortable feeling that will get even worse. When you can’t stand the pain take the pain pill and drink lots of water. When you have to “go” push hard and both times I did this my stream went from not much to a normal stream. Keep drinking water to see if you can pass anymore. Stop if your pain pill stops working but remember to push. Without a pain pill it would be terribly painful though.,14 people found this helpful,Size: 25 Count (Pack of 1)

I knew something was going on the last week with my urine it’s been dark and also been having nausea and testicle pains. I have a history of kidney stones but I didn’t connect the two because I always had severe pains in my flank the past times I’ve had stones. I have also been taking a low dose of chemo which messes with your liver so I was scared the medicine was affecting my liver even tho I had gotten my liver test the previous week. ( I’m a worry wart) I made a urologist appt and a gp appointment both are 2 weeks awa!! So I wanted to clean my liver and kidneys so I stumbled upon this tea while browsing. Based on the reviews which I’m always skeptical  about I bought the tea.  Received my order today. I got home from work at 5 drank the tea with alittle honey at 7:30. It just taste like unsweetened tea like green Tea not bad, not good but relaxing. Anyway, it’s now 10:30 I urinated 10 min ago, I felt stinging in my penis and when I tel you there was about 6-7 small stones in the bottom of the cup I know I have more in me because I still have penis pain I can actually feel them wanting to come out so I’m drinking crazy water right now anyway, the point to all of you was I was utterly amazed on how effective and fast this actually works. This is making me want to explore other herbal medicinal plants. This is an honest review it’s a miracle tea. I’m drinking this every Morning for the rest of my life.
