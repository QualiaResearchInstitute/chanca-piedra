SLOsurfer,35-44,less than 1 month,Other,2024-02-04,5,5,5,5,"Incredible. I am a skeptic and a scientist by training, so naturally I don't believe something like this could work, but with so many positive reviews, I had to try it. Two weeks ago I started passing my 3rd stone ever. The first two came out after hours of pain years ago, but this one got stuck in my ureter for almost two weeks. I took chanca piedra (bought through Amazon from Eu Natural Store), 2 capsules, 1200mg, once a day. Within exactly 48 hours, my stone was out. The first day I noticed what looked like fresh blood clot materials (floating) coming out and maybe some bits of sand. The second day I had what looked like old blood clot materials (little black discs slowly sinking) coming out, sometimes bits of sand, and then finally the whole 4mm stone (sank like rock). I am incredibly impressed by this product and am so relieved to have it out. It's certainly worth a try if you're suffering from kidney stones. I'm going to keep taking it for a couple weeks and see if the other stones sitting in my kidneys come out.",1,1

PattyPoo1234,45-54,less than 1 month,Gallstones,2023-11-18,3,3,3,3,"I just started taking this to see if it will help me with gallstones. I don't know if it will yet. I will come back and report if it does. I was having kidney stone problem. It was caused from hyperparathyroidism. Body making to much calcium. I advise anyone making large amounts of kidney stones or even just one to have pth and calcium levels checked. I had a fluctuating calcium level so I was hard to diagnose. I used my gut feeling and went to Norman Parathyroid Center in Florida and sure enough I had a large tumor on my parathyroid. I had one parathyroid removed. A lot of doctors ignore a high calcium level or recheck and it's normal the next time so they think you don't have a problem when you do. The truth is it can be fluctuating and causing you to have a kidney stone problem. Have your calcium and pth checked a few times not just a couple and see where it is. If you are over 40 and your calcium level is over 10, you are having issues. Your calcium level for your age should be 9-9.5 never over 10. Quit suffering and take the bull by it's horns and take care of the main problem. ",1,1

A bit of advice I read on another site was make sure you buy legitimate Chanca. Some online vendors might not be selling true product. We were able to buy the Chanca at a local health food store and the brand they had available was Whole World Botanicals (I paid for that product and am not being paid to mention that name). 400 mg capsules. 

The guy at the health food store mentioned the tea wouldn't be strong enough. I don't know if that's true, some ppl on these reviews said they used the tea with good results, but that was his opinion [and he had experience with stones]. Maybe it depends on the strength of it?

I started googling about kidney stones and I found that Chanca Piedra and Apple cider can help dissolve the stones. I found a local store that carried the product and I  bought it and also a bottle of Apple cider vinegar already mixed with honey and turmeric and I took them right away. The next day and for the following next 2 weeks, I was passing stones , 3 or 2 at time. I was able to recover 8 stones, some I could not because I was in public restrooms. It worked for me.

I've probably passed a hundred stones in my lifetime from the size of grain of sand to a small bullet. For the last ten years or so I generally did not have the agonizing pain associated with stones, but it was replaced with a dull ache that would linger for up to a month and would be triggered by any kind of physical activity. Even walking through the grocery store would set it off. I had a cat scan and it showed 'multiple' stones (generally meaning too many to count) and one very large one that was sitting right at the base of the kidney and potentially move around and block urinary flow. I was going to have lithotripsy again but the doctor was going to force me to have a stent which i don't need due to the size of the stones i've passed my whole life. I bought Stone Breaker off of Amazon and it has literally changed my life. I don't even take it every day, just when I start to feel any kind of burning, pain or any kind of disruption with my urine. I never passed any stone fragments and my urine did not appear cloudy as some of the reviews claimed. All I can say is that the lingering ache that plagued me for years is now gone. I can't believe it's a coincidence. Not sure if it changes the PH of my urine or what. I would be very curious to have another imaging of my kidneys done to see if that large stone is gone or has shrunk in size.

Well, natural medicine was here for millenia, and what used to kill human beings were infections. Everything else was pretty much taken care of with natural medicine. I am not trying to diagnose or treat anyone here, just telling my experience. Chanca piedra works, it doesn't matter what some people say. It has worked for thousands of years. In my particular case, it dissolved and released all of my kidney stones. After 4 weeks of taking the pills my stones are gone for good. I struggled for almost three years thinking I had spine problems, chronical back pain, but no MRI could show any problem. I had no idea what it was. I was in pain. I had no energy. I came across a MD who also studied traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine for over a decade in Japan. He diagnosed me with kidneystones. He also told me to try chanca piedra tea for some weeks, and my pain was gone. The big stones where still there though. That's when he told me to take the herbal pills, which is basically the same plant I was drinking as tea, in pills. 4 weeks later, I had no stones. I can't even tell when I released them. I felt no pain during the processes, and I obviously feel no pain now. Great product, I recommend you take it.

I have been plagued by kidney stones for the past 4 years, when I was diagnosed with innumerable kidney stones in both kidneys.  In May 2018 I had surgery to remove 5 kidney stones that were embedded in my ureter.  When I went back for follow-up, I still had blood in my urine, so more tests (ultrasound, CAT scan, KUB).  Another stone; this one was 8 mm and also in my ureter.  I was not in pain, but the location of the stone was causing my kidney to enlarge, so my doctor determined it would have to be removed and scheduled my surgery for 10/23/18.  The stone had been in the same location for the previous 10 weeks, and wasn't moving at all.  The thought of going through the surgery (and the stent they insert afterwards) was enough to prompt me to start searching for any alternatives.  I came across chanca piedra.  I read so many reviews from people who claimed it worked that I figured I'd try it; I had nothing to lose except $30.  The product I bought was Stone Breaker by EU Natural (and if you are wondering, the answer is NO, I have not been paid to write this review; I've not been in contact with the company that sold it to me, and I paid full price). I took the first dose on Tuesday; taking 2 tablets twice a day.  On Sunday morning, I passed the stone.  I am still in shock.  I almost can't believe it myself.   It came out in 5 pieces, like it was literally broken up.  I know if something seems too good to be true, it usually is.  But I can state, in absolute honesty, unequivocably, that this stuff worked!

I had to have an abdominal X-ray prior to my appointment to see if the stones had grown.    So about 8 weeks prior to this I decided to try Chanca Piedra in powder form, which I mixed according to directions,  and drank as a cold tea.   I did this for two weeks.   During the two weeks my joints ached which I felt was a side effect of the mixture and I had occasional back pain, but I was determined to see the two weeks out.   Im so glad I did, as the X-ray showed ZERO stones.  Iâm thrilled to say the least!   Bear in mind that a plain X-ray is not as detailed as a scan however my doc said that if there were any stones remaining that they would be so insignificant (small) they wouldnât be a problem.

Was it the chanca piedra or the cider/vinegar that did the job? Who knows, but next time I feel like a stone is developing I'll definitely include the chanca piedra formulation.

Right after I drink the tea, I start feeling very tired and sleepy. Long term usage would result in tiredness and fatigue.  The tea should not be used by people whose diet is low in fat and carbs!",93,101
,,1 to less than 2 years,Other,2010-02-17,5,5,5,5,"I took Chanca Piedra with another herb  Hercampuri, to treat Acid Reflux. It improved my condition within 2 months, but since it recurred occasionally I was advised to continue it for a year.     At the end of six months the acid reflux was gone. An unexpected benefit was the elimination of moderate/severe eczema that I had had for over 30 years! I stopped taking the extremely strong topical steroids and have not gone back, it has been almost 2 years since.     These herbs are wonderful. I had no side effects. I continued the treatment for another year as I reintroduced foods that formerly I had sensitivity to. I have tiny patches of eczema that have occasionally recurred when I indulge heavily in nuts or tomatoes. Nothing like what I had before.",89,93

This could be a coincidence, but after 12 hours the pain was gone.  I still have not expelled the stone after 2 days of use, but my energy level has returned.  I am feeling like myself again!",85,88
,55-64,6 months to less than 1 year,Other,2009-12-09,5,5,5,5,"I have suffered from Kidney Stones for most of my life. The most I have had at one time is 8. Needless to say this condition has had a significant impact on my life. I can not work when I have multiple stones and the pain is beyond words. I have spent up to a month waiting for a stone to pass. Also I have had several surgeries to remove the stone/stones at a considerable expense. The recovery from a kidney stone operation is dreadful with lots of pain and bleading. A friend sent me an article on Chanca Piedra (Phyllanthus niruri). I immediately purchased some in a capsule form 500 mg. I take it three times a day. Since taking this herbal supplement I have not had any kidney stones, when in the past I would get at least one every two months. I highly recommend that people try this herbal supplement if they suffer from kidney stones. It can be purchased at most local herbal shops or on line. It has worked for me.",191,196
