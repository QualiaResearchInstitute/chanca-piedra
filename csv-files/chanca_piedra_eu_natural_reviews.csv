After CT Scan one month later revealed bi-lateral kidney stones, and the one in my right kidney has actually increased 2mm in size since my last scan 3 years ago. Do not waste your money on this garbage.

undefined,chanca_piedra_eu_natural,John Huff,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 10, 2024",false,1.0 out of 5 stars,"While sitting on the couch watch TV, March 2, 2024, I felt a terrible pain in my left lower back.  The pain intensified in just a few short minuets.  I was on my knees in pain about to vomit, face sweating, and could not find relieve in any position.  After 4 hours of this, I started looking through the medicine cabinet for anything that would relieve the pain so I could get some sleep.  As I could only find ibuprofen, I took two, which seemed to help, Saturday mooring I felt great!  I was even able to get a P90X work-out in, before going shopping with my wife.  Halfway through shopping, my symptoms returned.  I couldn't wait to get back home and take something for the pain.  I remember feeling every bump in the road as it shot pain up my back.  Again, several ibuprofens and 45 minutes later the pain was gone!  I went to my family doctor on Monday, based on a urine sample, she said it looks like a kidney stone.  As this was my first, I had no idea what I was dealing with.  An X-Ray and Cat-scan that day confirmed a 7,5mm stone was stuck in my ureter.  As this was said to be too large to pass, she advised me to contact the Urology Group in Cincinnati, and she put me on Flowmax.  Researching this on the internet, I started drinking lots of water with lemon juice and apple cider vinger each day.  Although still no pain, on March 13, the Urology Group performed an Extracorporeal shockwave  Lithotripsy to break up the stone.  Although they said the procedure was successful, breaking the stone into two pieces, a day later only some gravel and a bee-bee size piece were expelled.  Although still no pain, two weeks later a follow-up X-ray revealed the stone was still 6,5mm and still stuck in my ureter.  Therefore, aside from pain of the procedure and a cost of $10,000, the Lithotripsy did very little, and the Urology Group then prescribed a more invasive procedure of using a laser to go inside and break it up.  Not looking forward to another procedure and encouraged by the many successful reviews, I ordered this product.  In addition to the Flowmax and drinking 2.5 liters of water per day with concentrated lemon juice, I have been taking it as prescribed for two weeks now, with no results whatsoever!  I was discouraged to hear that this company recently changed their ingredients and the reviews since then have been far less successful.  Unless the pain returns, I believe I will try to wait this out to see if it will eventually pass.  I will repost as this progresses, and hopefully share with all a success story, but for now, this product doesn't seem to help at all!  For the past week, I doubled down on the dosage, two in the morning two in the evening, still no results!",3 people found this helpful,Size: 60 Count (Pack of 1)

However, after a month of consistent use, I'm left feeling utterly disappointed and frustrated. This product did absolutely nothing to alleviate my discomfort or aid in passing my kidney stones.Despite following the recommended dosage diligently, I saw no improvement whatsoever. It's as if I might as well have been consuming plain water for all the good it did. Not only did it fail to break down my kidney stones as advertised, but it also failed to provide any relief from the excruciating pain I was experiencing.Save yourself the time and money – steer clear of this ineffective kidney stone breaker. It's nothing but a sham, offering false hope to those desperately seeking relief from the agony of kidney stones. I regret wasting my hard-earned money on such a useless product.

undefined,chanca_piedra_eu_natural,takeshia johnson,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2023",false,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Just a few sentences of medical history:I was diagnosed with gallstones in 2019. Since then, my attacks have gotten worse and worse. They used to last 15 to 30 minutes, and now they prolong for hours. So bad - I can expect to be out of commission for at least two days. But the thing of it is I don't want surgery and was trying to find any natural way to help dissolve my gallstones. By researching, I happen to come across Stonebreaker by Chanca Piedra. I read all the positive comments on this thread and decided why not. I gave it a go.I've taken these pills for the last 3 days. Morning and night with water and with my meal. No symptoms. I was thankful for that cause I was scared lol. On the fourth day, I had a late lunch - my first meal of the day. I ate lunch and took my pill. (I had a salad). About two hours later, I’m not even sure what the heck went wrong but my back and right side were KILLING me. I almost mistook it for a gallbladder attack, but eventually noticed the pain was something else - Not my usual gallbladder area under my breast, but my right kidney area (wrapping around my back and side). The pain was so heavy, it stopped me in my tracks and my husband helped me to the bed.My husband helped me by applying a heating pad to my kidney area. Within an hour the intense pain subsided. But the dull ache was still there. That was Saturday. I'm typing this Tuesday night and I can't bend over, twist and turn certain ways without that same dull intense pull/ache. And this happened on the 4th day of taking these pills. Sitting for long periods of time HURTS. Anything that applies pressure to my right kidney side HURTS. The only way I don't feel uncomfortable is if I stand.  I have never ever had a problem with my kidneys. Never. But now it seems I do. I'm praying the pain will just go away, but I will be visiting a Doctor Thursday if it doesn't.I honestly thought I was going to feel something in my gallbladder since there are stones there and not in my kidney, but that was NOT the case. At least for me, it wasn't. I discontinued use of these pills and will be doing more heavy research on them. I encourage you to do the same. I see that this is a good product for some people, and I'm glad they were able to help the majority. I’m not sure what went wrong with me. Maybe not enough water? Not enough rest? I am a very healthy girl except for my stones. I exercise and love eating healthy (especially since 2019). So, I don't know. I just felt like I should share my story because I know what it's like to have gallstones and have no hope of curing them with doctors always ready to cut on you. You are desperate for a solution and ready to try anything – I know I was. I will try to update my condition soon. But in the meantime, if you consider this product, just make sure you do HEAVY research on it.

To start, I got word of this product from a youtube video, someone said that it worked very well also the reviews were outstanding.  However,my experience was very different. About 2 months ago I had my first gallbladder attack ,extremely painful and scary. I eat a very healthy whole foods diet prior, so taking this I figured would only aid in getting rid of any further attack or previous stones from not eating the best when I was younger. I bought my first bottle. Followed the instructions and for about 2 weeks, there was no pain, no sign of gallbladder attacks, I was convinced that this was the reason. I was so excited that I bought another bottle to have on hand before my first ran out. After 2 weeks of taking it,I was doubled over in severe pain. Worst pain of my life and nothing would take it away. After 2 days of chronic pain I was rushed to the ER where they told me I had a lodged stone, and pancreatitis due to the lodged stone. Worst pain you will ever feel! Also i was told that i would need my gallbladder removed immediately.  When removing my gallbladder a duct was clogged with what was described as sludge and mini stones. Now this could be a coincidence or this product was breaking up stuff and got it stuck in my duct causing all these issues. It is no joke when I say, take these with a risk. If stones are breaking rapidly they can cause a clog. I am all about natural products, but I fear this could do more harm than good. 2 bottles, waste of money. Would not recommend.

I recently had my gallbladder surgically removed because the stones were not ""broken"" but my gallblader had become inflamed and was a danger to my other organs.This isn't a cheap product, so think twice if you think you can break any gallbladder stones using this product regularly for an extended period of time. I cancelled my subscription and will apply that money towards supplements that help with my situation. I didn't give it one star, because like I said, maybe it works wonders for kidneys. But they should be honest about it truly working for both because kidney stones and gallbladder stones are different balls of wax, so I should have been more dubious of their claims. I guess I was hoping to avoid surgery in the future, but here I am recovering from surgery. If your abdominal pain increases like mine did, get a doctor to do an ultrasound and/or CAT scan to see if your gallbladder has gotten worse like mine did.

He has not passed the stone yet. However, he is able to get through the day without puking or ending up on the ground in tears since he began taking the product.

Many tests later, the scan came back showing that my stone is still in my track and it will need to be removed with surgery. I found Stone Breaker and ordered it immediately. The package came a day late so I am trying to play catch up in taking the pills in hopes of passing the stone before my scheduled surgery 1/17/22. I have taken 6 pills total over the last 2 days and have not passed any stone yet but I will say this is the first time in weeks I haven't had to take any pain medication. These herbs have definitely taken away my pain and have helped tremendously in helping me urinate. For weeks I've been sitting in warm baths for hours but since taking the herbs I haven't taken a single bath and have slept through the night. I was told that one week before surgery I would need to stop taking any vitamins or herbal supplements before surgery which would mean I have to stop today. I am so determined to pass this without surgery I am going to take these for 1 more day in hopes I get lucky and can cancel surgery. I read a review here online of an x-ray technician stating if the stone is obstructing your tract then these will not help. Unfortunately mine is obstructing my tract so If i don't pass it before my surgery, I'll know why. Either way I plan to continue taking this medicine after surgery as a preventative.

I initially took 2 capsules per day as directed, but after one month, tapered down to 1 capsule a day as I wasn't having UTI-like symptoms anymore and it was more in hopes of preventing more stones/existing stones from growing. The symptoms I did have (frequent nocturia, UTI-like symptoms of burning and pain) resolved after less than a week of taking two capsules per day.September 2021, had another CT scan to find the 1.5mm stone vanished (I wasn't aware of passing anything, and I understand it can be excruciating) and the 2.5mm stone is now 3mm but the Hounsfield density decreased from 400-something to 300-something.Other habits I picked up included:1. Drinking the juice of two fresh lemons every day2. Avoiding all high oxalate foods (former keto dieter, unfortunately)3. Ensuring I get enough dairy when I do eat moderately-high oxalate foods4. Drinking 5+ liters of water a day depending on my activity level.I'm certainly not going to stop taking this supplement if there's even a 1% percent chance it helped get rid of the other stone and saved me the suffering of passing it. Here's to hoping the remaining stone will stop growing! All in all, highly recommend.",17 people found this helpful,Size: 60 Count (Pack of 1)

This chance piedra has a similar effect with this brand in particular doing the best job in replicating the effect of the prescription drug. I would get this dull back pain and the doctor proscribed me flow max for a stricture I had dialiated but was still having symptoms. It helped, but it had a weird side effect of retrograde ejactulation and was not as pleasurable without the medicine. This one, has no side effects, just works. I’ve been using it on and off when I have pain with good results. It really seems like a natural way to relax things, but don’t buy it expecting a miracle that your stone will break.

This showed the Kidney stones - two of them, slightly smaller than a pair of dice.He did not have any easy solutions for me - surgery would be very expensive.  So I went to a naturalist who recommended Magnesium tablets, which I took for about two weeks.  I did not sense any results, so I started hunting for something else on the web, and found these on Amazon.  Along with the Magnesium tablets, I started taking these tablets (or maybe they were capsules - I do not remember) twice a day.  This worked.  After about a week of taking these twice a day with about 8 oz of water, the stone passed, relatively painlessly.  The only problem was the the pills seemed to cause bouts with sudden, unexpected, and almost uncontrollable diarrhea. This started the third day, I think.This was still vastly preferable to other ways of dealing with the stones, and the pills may not have this effect on you.  I have no way of knowing.

The doctor came back in the room and said he was going to prep me for surgery again I was pumped up with morphine no pain thought I would just go home and investigate further as far as homeopathic cures then I stumbled across this chanca Piedra which as I understand translates to stonebraker figured for $30 what did I have to lose. So I took two a day for about 4 weeks had no flare-ups stop taking them for a while had a flare up Fourth of July 2018 at a barbecue on my way home became nauseous threw up when I got to my driveway got in the house took two capsules lay down and literally within 15 minutes felt completely fine I have  had a few other flare-ups in the meantime and I always carry a few of these with me every single time I have had one I popped two of these and pain is gone don't know why the doctors don't recommend this before surgery but I feel like it's a miracle cure.Update: Okay so I had another gallstone attack yesterday (9-27-18) at 4 am I woke up with a slight pain and got up immediately and took two caps. NOTHING! Pain increased to the point after 4 hours I was taken to the emergency room again to get Morphine. I probably shouldn't have eaten the three greasy tacos late the night before.

I hope the stone is gone. I will certainly update my review at that point.  He's not hurting right now so I'm thinking the stone breaker is helping.

I was also diagnosed with gallstones a couple years ago, so I thought it might help with that, too. A week into taking it the stones passed without pain, but I was having discomfort in my gallbladder region. I waited another week and then went to the ER (I don’t have a regular doctor and this is beyond urgent care). Turns out I had a 6mm gallstone blocking my bile duct. But I wasn’t in real pain, just moderately uncomfortable (although sustained discomfort takes a toll, too). I ended up having to have my gallbladder removed but I am pretty sure it was Stonebreaker that kept me from the excruciating pain I should have, by all rights, been in. I gave it 4 stars only because this is obviously anecdotal and it may not have been the reason for my lack of pain. But that in conjunction with my lack of pain passing the stones makes me give these the credit, for what my anecdote is worth. I’d recommend it for anyone with chronic stones of both types.",8 people found this helpful,Size: 60 Count (Pack of 1)

I hope my review will bring you hope if you are struggling with kidney stones.It started in the summer of 2022 when I was 4 months pregnant. At the time, it was UTI like symptoms. Due to my pregnancy, I was unable to take any type of herbal supplements I was just given pain medication. I dealt with the intolerable pain for two months and when I was 6 months pregnant I had emergency removal of 2 stones one on each side- 0.5mm and 0.8mm following stent placement for a week and stent removal and yes- that felt like I was giving birth. MRI performed before the removal of the stones showed I had 2 smaller stones on each kidney which were not removed during the procedure.Fast forward a year later- July 2023 I started with UTI like symptoms once again. I knew right away they were the kidney stones. I went to my urologist to test for a UTI and she confirmed there was indeed blood in urine confirming stones. I decided to try this product as it was my only and last hope as I was preparing myself for yet another removal procedure and financial strain on my savings. Ordered on Sunday night, product arrived on Tuesday and took as followed:1. Tuesday night- I had excruciating pain (pain level 9). It got worse when I took a glass with lime. Flank pain started and I took two supplements. Thirty minutes later I had very little to no urine and my bladder was hurting. I was debating whether to go to the ER. About 45 min into the pain I felt sharp pinching as the stone was moving down my urethra. Immediately after the sharp pinching feeling I was able to urinate.  Pain diminished slowly and was able to rest for the night.2. Wednesday morning- While fasting as soon as I woke up I took another glass with lime and added apple cider vinegar. I took one supplement with it. I was feeling ok throughout the morning with mild UTI like burning symptoms. By the afternoon after having some lunch, I had another glass with lime and apple cider vinegar. My pain increased to sharp pinching feeling in my urethra and pressure. I knew the stone was there and was a matter of time before I urinated it out. About an hour into my pain when laying down the sharp feeling intensified and all of a sudden it was gone- instant relief?! I ran to the restroom I heard a clank on the toilet bowl and there it was the stone!I will continue to take this to hopefully dissolve the others out. I highly recommend this product along with taking it with lime water and apple cider vinegar. I hope to never look back on kidney stone surgery removal and I hope you never have to go through that.

I am a alliterative health practitioner applied kinesiology 22 years experience. Stones form in the liver and make there way to the gallbladder and they will only show up on a ultrasound or X-ray if they are calcified. Stones can be big or small and feel like a lump of clay. They are green tan or white. Depending on how old  they are white are the newest formed tan then green are older. Green is the colour of liver bile and what gives your poop the brown colours. You can also have chaff which is a gritty sludge and looks like bits of rice. Stress Fungus parasites built up in the body can clog the pipes. The liver is your filter of cholesterol old hormones old blood cells etc etc so when its clogged up you will be tired, cranky,  weird hungry pains. Hormonal imbalances, migraines headaches and intolerance for greasy fatty foods and alcohol. And raise your cholesterol in the body as it is not being filtered out properly.This supplement is a godsend to people chronically ill with digestive upsets and much more.  It cleans the gunk out. Hope that helps.",6 people found this helpful,Size: 60 Count (Pack of 1)

This product combined with drinking large, but reasonable amounts of water works quite well.

The doc told me that if it had made it that far it ""might"" pass or I could be admitted and get a stent.  I took my chances with a diruetic, pain meds, and an antibiotic.  After about a day, it passed to my bladder but was then stuck again.  I took two of these every 4-6 hours and (painfully) passed the stone within about 36 hours. Radiography showed another 7mm stone in my left kidney and a 9mm stone and 3mm stone in my right.  So I continued taking the supplements once daily as a preventative and did well for four months; however, I had a three week lapse when we had some summer schedule changes.  Alas, pain on the right side.  I started them again and my pain went away within two days.  Could it be my increase in water intake?  Sure.  Could it be a coincidence?  Yeah.  Could it be a placebo effect?  I suppose. Am I ordering a second bottle and setting a daily reminder to tell me to take it?  Yup.",46 people found this helpful,Size: 60 Count (Pack of 1)

Let me repeat, she passed a 6mm stone and didn’t even know it!!  It’s my belief that the stone breaker helped to reduce its size so much that it passed without her knowing. Do I have scientific proof of that?  No I don’t but I don’t know how else to explain it. Got a stone?  Give it a try!",15 people found this helpful,Size: 60 Count (Pack of 1)

I was skeptical, because what if it had just gone away on its own? Nope. Stopped taking them, and two days later I could feel it in my ureter. Insane, sharp pain. Took these pills, and within an hour or two I felt totally normal. Two days after that, it seems like the stone might be gone.

I am a retired nurse and watched my hubby suffer from passing a couple of kidney stones a few years ago. Fast forward to this year and he started the passing process again. Got all of his drugs on board and just for “grins” I researched herbal supplements to help and found these. Read the reviews and bought them. (had a CTscan Wed and had 3 stones, 1- 3mm in the R, 1-7mm in the L and 1? in Size in the ureter junction going into the bladder.) Started his Friday night thru Sat evening and late Saturday night he passed (see pic) a lot of what we term as “gravel”. Of course instant relief. I had him finish the supplement and then boom, the pain began again. Ordered another bottle, saw the doctor and got another CTScan which said the 3mm stone was descending down the ureter. Got the bottle of supplement Thursday and started him on them immediately. Saturday afternoon he comes out of the bathroom (didn’t screen) and says “I think I just passed 2 stones”  I didn’t get to see them but I did see the next sample with blood clots so I figured he did and all his pain was gone. We are now a month without any pain and NO surgery. He and I are believers.",118 people found this helpful,Size: 60 Count (Pack of 1)
