Potassium citrate,Nutricost Potassium Citrate,CrashSensei,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2024",true,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This product seems like a standard potassium supplement, but it does not raise your body's potassium levels. Potassium citrate is for kidney stones. Potassium chloride is for low potassium levels.  I didn't realize this and a week after switching to this product my heart arrythmia came back with a vengeance.I do not doubt the quality of this product. My low review is because the product page does not state this vital aspect.",2 people found this helpful,Size: 500 Count (Pack of 1)

Potassium citrate,Nutricost Potassium Citrate,Diogenes,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2022",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am one of the unfortunate 5% of kidney stone sufferers who have suffered from uric acid kidney stones. My urologist had prescribed me a 1000 mg. potassium citrate pill, timed release, 1 per day but then my insurance informed me this prescription product was no longer covered and I would need to pay $80 per month for it. (Potassium citrate changes the ph of urine and prevents kidney stone formation.) I decided to go with this product, 4 capsules morning and evening, and I've used this in lieu of the prescription stuff for about 3 years now and have not had any kidney stone attacks. I informed my urologist of this fact and he's noted it to recommend to others who may be in need of this product. This has worked for me and, anecdotally, I endorse it as a solution for this purpose as it has saved me over $2K in expense over the last few years. As always, YMMV.",83 people found this helpful,Size: 500 Count (Pack of 1)

Potassium citrate,Nutricost Potassium Citrate,Isaac Gomez,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2021",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I saw a review bashing these pills because they don’t have near enough potassium for daily needs. I just want to address that this isn’t for people needing more potassium. These were recommended to me for helping break down and prevent future kidney stones, and after researching this claim looks to be true. Everything about this product does seem promising to me as far as quality goes. These are a long term solution for kidney stones, so I can’t verify that part.  I just can’t justify reviewing these negatively if they don’t work as I’ve seen that they are hit or miss from person to person. It’s worth a shot, especially if you’ve dealt with the pain of passing a stone!",11 people found this helpful,Size: 500 Count (Pack of 1)

This one is mainly used to help with kidney stones, which I don’t have. I gave the product low stars because they all should say in their description what they are used to help ail/ cure/heal. Save people from trying to research the different potassium varieties.",4 people found this helpful,Size: 500 Count (Pack of 1)

Potassium citrate,Nutricost Potassium Citrate,Nancy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2019",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My doctor recommended I take Potassium Citrate to help prevent kidney stones. She had given me a prescription for this but not only was the price prohibitive, but the side effects of the drug were frightening, so I showed her this product and she suggested I try it. I have been taking these capsules twice a day for several days and have to say there are no side effects to comment about. They are easy to swallow and so far, so good. I am going to give them about a month or two and when I see my doctor again and she runs tests, that will be the true telling of its worth. I'll check in about this around the end of August.",88 people found this helpful,Size: 500 Count (Pack of 1)

Have to take 15-20 a day but easy to swallow, the stones have passed, no more blood in my urine, pH better, potassium levels back up where they should be and hopefully will test good for citrate levels at end of the month.But I will warn that should consult with your doctor if using like I did to make sure your situation requires this amount.
