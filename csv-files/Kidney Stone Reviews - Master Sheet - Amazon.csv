It switched from my left kidney to my right and after it switched sides, I only produced a single stone the first time then the pain of passing a stone was occurring every few weeks. After a while I would produce bloody urine frequently and I finally got a CT scan to confirm what I feared. a 2cm stone was in my right kidney. The nephrologist said ""your kidney is functioning in normal levels"" so they didn't suggest doing anything about it and I'm seriously dumbfounded, because of the amount of pain I was in.

Within a month I was back to feeling normal and I decided to take a bottle's worth of 1 pill a day as maintenance. I ran out and felt fine so I didn't get a new bottle. 1 year later, I bought another bottle as I passed a small stone. This stuff truly is amazing.

218,Chanca piedra,Amazon,"EU Natural: ""Stone Breaker"" chanca piedra",https://www.amazon.com/STONE-BREAKER-Chanca-Piedra-Gallbladder/dp/B01FERIHYE/,This stuff really works,"I wish I'd heard about this amazing product years ago. I just spent over a month in the hospital and a nursing home over a .50 calibre kidney stone which damaged my one functioning kidney, causing me to develop Septicemia. I was in a coma for 2 weeks, and almost died. They put 2 Stents in me, a painful and uncomfortable process, and used sonics twice to try and break the stone up went thru the Stent and sonics once before in 2018 on a smaller stone. I put lemon juice in all my drinks every day to deal with these stones, and have passed many smaller stones since then. My 1st Dt said my body socks every nutrient out of my food, and it stores them in my body. I have calcium deposits in my heart too. He thinks it's a survival trait designed for ancient times when food was scarce and hard to come by. But in the modern world of convenience food, it's causing me grief. I thought his theory was goofy until several years later, I had to undergo multiple hip replacement surgeries and my orthopedic surgeon told me I had the thickest bones he ever saw. ""Like a gorilla""s, he said. My orthopedic problems are caused from me being extremely double jointed. I develop them quickly whenever I get lax and don't consume enough of the lemon juice ( due to not being able to find it in stores. I live in a very rural area with limited supply options). Anyway, I never heard of Stone Breaker until this latest bout of kidney stone misery. They call them stones, but they look and feel like shards of broken glass, especially when you pass them. It starts with an extreme pain in your lower back. Like you've been run thru with a spear. Then, over the course of several hours you can feel the stone fragment moving up and over your hip bone and down into your groin area. If you've suffered them before, the pain is so incredible you're afraid to pee! The first time I passed one, the ordeal was so awful that I gripped the door frame so hard in the bathroom, that I damaged the wood and indented it! (Now, I grip the handle of my heavy duty metal cane). When the stones come out (thank God!!!) You can hear them hitting the sides of your toilet bowl or urinal jug. What a miserable ordeal of agony! Anyway, last week after having the 3rd Stent put in me, I found out about Stone Breaker and upon reading the testimonials I ordered it. Upon arrival I took it. The very next day after taking it I began to pass more stones, albeit they were much smaller and smoother, and nowhere near as painful as stones I had passed before. Stone Breaker really seems to work, just as other victims of this terrible affliction have attested. I can vouch for it too! Oh if only I had known about it earlier, perhaps I could have saved myself a ton of misery, time and a mountain of medical bills.

226,Chanca piedra,Amazon,"EU Natural: ""Stone Breaker"" chanca piedra",https://www.amazon.com/STONE-BREAKER-Chanca-Piedra-Gallbladder/dp/B01FERIHYE/,Digestive Issues Alleviated,"I was diagnosed in March 2019 with gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining). The doctors did a CT scan and another different scan but found nothing wrong with anything else. While this is probably a common issue I realized early in my journey to recovery that digestive issues start with the gallbladder and liver. I did not want to continue on the Proton Pump Inhibitors that the doctor prescribed to alleviate the acid buildup in my stomach (it made me feel more bloated). The only way to rid the pain and bloat was celery juice in the morning, intermittent fasting and 40 minute workouts twice a day (I also changed my diet). While this worked through 2019 and 2020, I know I wasn't always going to have access to cardio equipment every day. Covid hit 2020 so fast forward to August 2021 and I started feeling that weird pressure over my gallbladder again. I was able to rid the pain but not the pressure. I came across this product while searching Amazon for supplements and read the reviews. The majority of people had great outcomes so I bought a bottle. I've only taken one a day so far but it has been really fast acting right away, reduced the pressure under my right ribs quickly. I take one with my morning meal with a Calcium, Magnesium Zinc tablet. One NAC tablet, B12, Vit D3 with 1 capsule each of Milk Thistle (liver support) and lecithin. I would also drink Roasted Dandelion Root Tea for my digestion. I was taking the vitamins and supplements before the Stonebreaker capsule was added in recently. This combo really helped a lot. But one thing I noticed, the Stonebreaker addition makes you go do #2 ALOT IN quantity in the beginning. I'm assuming it's cleaning out your backed up system and helping bile move from liver to gallbladder for fatty breakdown. I recently gave one capsule to my sister (has diabetes) to see if it would help her although she is so skinny I don't know if she had anything to get rid of internally. SURPRISE! She said it really cleaned out her colon. UPDATE 12/3/21 I gave a capsule to my cousin as she was having trouble going to the bathroom to urinate several times a night and felt like she was still full right after she would go. We thought it would help her kidneys. She took only one and 3 days later went to the emergency room with excruciating pain from a dislodged kidney stone. We kind of assumed it was dislodged by the Chanca Piedra preventing the formation of stones and since the stone wasn't growing larger it broke down and was able to travel to her bladder. She kept drinking lemon water and celery juice for a week after and hasn't felt any pain since then in November. Although she was freaked out by the kidney pain when it happened she since doesn't want to take the Stone Breaker at all. But I will keep taking it as my pain has subsided to nothing. UPDATE 2 My cousin decided to continue taking it and increased her water intake and drinking specific teas for kidney support.

I was diagnosed with 4-5 mm kidney stone stuck in my ureter. This is my first time ever having a kidney stone. My doctor told me it was likely not going to pass because of the size & location but prescribed some medicine & said we could wait it out for a couple of weeks. I prefer natural remedies so decided not to take the prescription. A few days later I had a kidney stone attack & was in so much pain, inflamed, flank pain, running to the toilet literally every 10 min for nothing but dribbles, slight nausea, & I could barely walk so stayed in bed all day. Long story short I made an anti-inflammatory juice shot (ginger root, apple, orange, lemon, tumeric powder, & black pepper). About 30 min later I started feeling better!! The pain, inflammation, & nausea subsided! I wad able to move around & cook dinner. I decided to try the chanca piedra to help in passing the stone. After 3 days of the juice shot 2x/day & the chanca piedra 3x/day my urinary retention cleared! I was no longer dribbling. I was determined to pass the stone naturally so I pushed my follow up appt out to 2 months & for those 2 months this was my daily remedy : 1.) drank 12-16 cups of water daily starting the morning off with 2 cups of warm lemon or lime water, 2.) chanca piedra 3x/ day, & 3.) a cup of ACV water (2 Tbsp unfiltered organic apple cider vinegar) 5x/day (*1 week on & 1 week off*).

This brand is superior to the other one and it was great. I don't take these every day, but nearly. When I feel that feeling, and you all know it too well, I take 3 (not the recommended dose) and wait a bit. Usually that's all it takes. If I still feel iffy, and that's rare, I take 3 more later, but not too close together.

The familiar pain started right after that- not as bad as the first, but it didn't look like fun. Problem was her urologist's practice shut down because of Covid, her only other option was the ER, and she didn't want to go yet. I researched and found this stuff, and after looking through the literature to make sure I wasn't poisoning her, I started her on it. I really didn't think much was going to happen, but wanted to try this before we did the ER shuffle once again. Since she was up and about despite the discomfort, she agreed. After 8 days of her using the toilet with the screen funnel she was given after the first litho, she passed the fragments. This stuff actually worked for her- she cleared all the fragments. Went through the literature again and found it's been used and studied, mostly in South American hospitals, with a reasonable number of good outcomes.

In the beginning, i would get 1 every other year but the past 4 years, i get them like evey few months. Ive been to a urologist, been on potassium citrate, lowered my sodium, cut back on high oxalate foods, taken 24 hr urine tests.. And before taking this pill, the only thing that kinda helped was taking a good probiotic (there is research that shows that certain strains of probiotics will bind with oxalates and prevent them from binding with calcium to form a stone). I came across a different brand of chanca peidra back in october and took it for about a month (4 pills daily) but nothing passed (it is now april). Last year at a urologist check up and an ultrasound, i had a 6 mm stone in my right kidney and a 5mm stone on left side. So that's what led me to try chanca piedra last oct. Fast forward to first week of april, i started to feel mild back pain and i knew it was the stone moving (but this has been ongoing since feb 2020). So i decided to try this brand of chanca piedra. I received it on apr 14... Took 2 a day for about 5 days.. Then i stopped.. No reason why just forgot to keep taking it. And today is apr 24 and i passed the dark stone (see pic).. Now the only way for me to know for sure if it is the 5mm or 6mm stone is to have an ultrasound or ct or mri.. But I'm willing to bet that it is indeed the 6mm that was in my right side. For me, i believe these pills helped as i have been trying everything the urologist prescribed for over a year now with no results until this.

Well not the kind that smokes weed but the kind that forms them. Always in my left kidney. Two weeks ago I went to the ER after 4 non-stop hours of excruciating pain, with vomiting, and all sorts of spasms, just so I get get my morphine fix and have some peace. CT scan showed a 5mm making it journey down the the pleasure tube. No, not that tube yet, the ureter. The Dr also gave me some other great news and said I had another one in the left kidney but couldn't tell me the size since the stone was difficult to see in the scan. The next day I passed the 5mm one. The one remaining in my left kidney was giving me all sorts of back, bladder, groin pain. So I decided to buy Chanca Piedra to see if these reviews were real. Well, 6 days in and I'm seeing some serious busting. As I pee today, there are fragments coming out similar to how fragments came out after I got lithotripsy on a 10mm stone about 7 years ago. It's interesting since I thought this product would just dissolve and make it smaller and smaller, but its actually busting it like the name it gives itself.

Of course by now I'm dreading the results and then the doc looks up from the paperwork and says everything looks pretty good. I'm like huh? He said in Spanish I have stones. Ahhhhh phew! Relief it was. The ultrasound showed 3 stones and he said maybe head over to get an MRI to check the rest. At least my kidneys looked good, but that didn't stop the pain. The doc sends me out the door with a script for Ketorolac and Rowatinex. I had never heard of either before now. I picked up the pastillas and headed home. Not even 24 hours later I felt relief. Maybe a fluke right? Took the Ketorolac for only 5 days(apparently it's no bueno after that) and the Rowatinex for 2 weeks. I can't tell if one passed or not, but I felt Great!!!

The doctor said he had a kidney infection and some blood in his urine. He took antibiotics for 10 days, but still we saw blood in his urine. On the tenth day he had another more minor attack of pain. During this time, since I've always believed in natural cures, I started looking on Amazon for products to get rid of stones. I found 'stone blasters' with good reviews, but reviewers often said the pain of passing the stones would still be there regardless. Then I saw the Rowatinex reviews and noticed instead reviewers saying stones passed without pain, that they either became very soft or broke apart. I looked into the product some more online and only found good reviews, no bad ones, with no side effects, so this is the one I ordered. Since people used it for eliminating stones but also for prevention of stones, I'll be taking them as well, and also keep some on hand. After a day of taking the Rowatinex my husband was no longer passing blood, he's just finishing his first bottle (2 bottles in the box). I read online he should take them for a month, he's been on 2 three times a day. He hasn't had any more pain, blood, or problems since starting them. Amazon products always come quickly, within a few days, so while waiting I had him start drinking pure apple juice which is supposed to soften stones, which he continues to drink. I gave him a cup of cranberry tea each evening as well (he doesn't like cranberry juice) as cranberry is good for the urinary tract. I've known people who've had kidney stones and the bad pain they experience especially when passing them. From all the reviews I've read now on Rowatinex I'm very confident he won't have another attack. I'm going to also purchase their other product for gallstones. I know blood in the urine is not a good sign and can be scary but I read sometimes it's simply just the stones scraping the duct it's passing through. If the blood returns I'll definitely make sure he goes back to the doctor but I'm thinking this product has taken care of the problem. I wish I could say he actually saw a stone that passed but this is our first experience with kidney stones, we're not sure if he'd notice one 'come out', esp. if this product allows them to pass without pain.

The first time I went to the doctor ('93) I found out I had stones in both kidneys, a total of 15 stones altogether. I did the ESWL procedure and had a double ""J"" stint inserted (never again) the first round. A few years later I developed more stones went through the ESWL procedure once again. I had to take a few days off work after that one. Since 1993, I have passed dozens of stones (I have lost track it has been so many), mine are calcium based. I was on an on/off monthly cycle (one month on, one month off) of magnesium which seemed to help for a number of years; this was before I had heard of Rowatinex. At the beginning of 2012 the stones had returned once again, I used a heating pad along with Midol (yes, Midol) and Aleve for the pain. I ran across Rowatinex and read the reviews and thought I would give it a shot. Like the reviews within 24 hours I passed a decent sized stone (not sure of the size but a little smaller than a pea). Within the next two weeks I passed smaller stones but they were mostly sand-like and they all passed with the greatest of ease. My wife ordered the Rowatinex on a Wednesday afternoon and I had them by that Saturday. The pills are round and easy to swallow; you receive two jars each with 50 capsules. During the first day I did notice a camphor smell when burping but only happened once. Yes, the instructions are written in German but there is a small section in English, basically I take 2 capsules three times a day. I love this stuff! It is much cheaper and less painful than paying for the ESWL surgery.

Whenever I am about to pass a stone, It usually starts with blood in the urine and pain in the back from the kidney area and then I can actually feel the stone gradually, slowly and painfully move all through the urinary tract over the course of 2 to 5 days. So in August 2011, I got the initial symptoms of a stone again, and after having passed a huge 7mm stone the previous year (that got stuck, ""OUCH"") I went looking for options, and saw very good reviews about Rowatinex mainly from European and South American sites but not much info from the US; So I ordered it next day delivery and tried it at the dosage listed on the box. The first thing I noticed was the ""camphor"" smelling burps, then an increase in thirst and urination, and that is it for side effects as far as I can tell. After a day of taking the pills, I felt the stone move from the kidney, to the ureter (the tube between the kidney and the bladder) and it got stuck, (so it must have been a big one), a few painful jumping jacks later to help dislodge it, and off to the bladder it went, then I would have expected it's final agonizing travel to the urethra over a few days, but oh surprise, that never happened, after a couple more days of taking the pills it passed as sand which I could barely tell was there, I was very impressed! After it went out, I stopped taking the capsules, so I still had most of them left. Fast forward to December, and here comes a new one, as soon as the symptoms started, I immediately went for the Rowatinex!. Not even 12 hours after the first capsule, and out it went, PAINLESSLY! one thing I noticed is that it made the stone brittle, as opposed to diamond hard as I used to pass before taking Rowatinex. After years of buying stuff on Amazon this is the first review I post, I'm just that impressed and don't even mind that it is selling now for $10 less than when I bought it. I'm just glad Amazon offers it. It really seems that the insurance companies in the US rather have you get ultrasound therapy or surgery as opposed to getting a simple, cheap (it sells for $12 in South America and Europe, and $8 in Cuba) all natural capsule that takes care of the problem.

It's not. It's not one of those super-diluted pills that relies on your placebo effect to help you (or however homeopathic meds work). The ingredients of Rowatinex are: Pinine, Campheme, Cineol, Fenchone, Borneol, Anethol, Olive Oil. My dad's sister, who lives in Europe, was telling him about this product when he was complaining about getting a kidney stone for the first time in over 10 years. [He injured his knee and had to completely stop jogging for a year, and we're guessing this might have had something to do with why he started getting kidney stones again.] She said her doctor's given it to her before and even her dog has gotten it from the vet. My dad tried this product and used the directions on the box. We had been to the emergency room something like the night before, and scans showed he had three kidney stones, the worst one being something like 5 or 6mm in diameter. A few days after starting Rowatinex, my dad finally passed his kidney stone. Instead of being the normal, crumbly rock, it came out as kind of gooey and in the shape of an elongated tube. He said it was 9mm in length, though the diameter was much smaller. And he could barely feel it pass. Though, for the record, he was on good pain pills, but the pain pills didn't seem to help much in the beginning, before Rowatinex. Since then, he's been taking Rowatinex at a greatly reduced rate than what is on the box. It's been something like one to two years, and still no returned kidney stones (though he's also modified his diet a bit to exclude things like nuts, and he's able to jog a little bit again).

I've been their biggest cheerleader, always directing others with kidney stones to their product. However, when I went to reorder recently, I could not find the 1000 mg tablets they've carried in the past, so I contacted the company directly and was told that they no longer carry or make the 1000 mg tabs, only a 500 mg powder-filled capsule now instead.

It switched from my left kidney to my right and after it switched sides, I only produced a single stone the first time then the pain of passing a stone was occurring every few weeks. After a while I would produce bloody urine frequently and I finally got a CT scan to confirm what I feared. a 2cm stone was in my right kidney. The nephrologist said ""your kidney is functioning in normal levels"" so they didn't suggest doing anything about it and I'm seriously dumbfounded, because of the amount of pain I was in. Pain makes us think differently, My next step was to figure out a way to make a DIY lithotripsy machine. Luckily I found the stonebreaker chanca piedra. Within a month I was back to feeling normal and I decided to take a bottle's worth of 1 pill a day as maintenance. I ran out and felt fine so I didn't get a new bottle. 1 year later, I bought another bottle as I passed a small stone.This stuff truly is amazing.

Taking them together can lead to a more significant drop than intended, potentially causing dizziness and lightheadedness.Electrolyte imbalance: Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic that can cause the body to lose electrolytes, particularly potassium.

My last lithotripsy was a few months ago in September for a 1.3 centimeter stone. My last xray was clear, but the CT scan showed alot of fragments still in that kidney. I decided to try chanca piedra and started taking it. It was a different brand in pill form. I took it daily from that time for 3 months and it didn't help move out any additional stones. I didnt want more buildup back to a large stone again, so I decided to try this brand in liquid form instead. Ive been taking it once a week for about a month. On Thursday I felt a sharp pain in my right side just for a few minutes. I knew a stone was coming down the ureter. I came home and took a dose of this. This morning, I unknowingly passed 2 small stones. The stones were soft and disintegrated when I touched them with a Q-tip. They did not have the hard sharp edges that my prior ones did. I had no pain at all and didn't even know I had passed them! I can't believe it softened them that much! I know i have more, so I just ordered another bottle. I am going to take it daily instead of weekly. This liquid form works so much better than the pill form in other brands. I am going to continue taking this to try to move it all out and as a preventative after that. People need to have patience, sometimes this doesn't work overnight and sometimes it literally does. Some stones are more stubborn with higher or different mineral compositions and crystal concentration. One thing I promise it does, it 100% softens them and makes them much less painful as they pass from the kidneys to the bladder because the sharp edges are gone! I highly recommend giving this a try if you suffer from them like I have!",5,226,2021-01-17,,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,Better than: pill form,,1,,liquid,"daily, weekly","1.3cm stone, soft stones",,,1,,,,,,1,,,,335,LLM

The pain intensified in just a few short minuets.  I was on my knees in pain about to vomit, face sweating, and could not find relieve in any position.  After 4 hours of this, I started looking through the medicine cabinet for anything that would relieve the pain so I could get some sleep.  As I could only find ibuprofen, I took two, which seemed to help, Saturday mooring I felt great!  I was even able to get a P90X work-out in, before going shopping with my wife.  Halfway through shopping, my symptoms returned.  I couldn't wait to get back home and take something for the pain.  I remember feeling every bump in the road as it shot pain up my back.  Again, several ibuprofens and 45 minutes later the pain was gone!  I went to my family doctor on Monday, based on a urine sample, she said it looks like a kidney stone.  As this was my first, I had no idea what I was dealing with.  An X-Ray and Cat-scan that day confirmed a 7,5mm stone was stuck in my ureter.  As this was said to be too large to pass, she advised me to contact the Urology Group in Cincinnati, and she put me on Flowmax.  Researching this on the internet, I started drinking lots of water with lemon juice and apple cider vinger each day.  Although still no pain, on March 13, the Urology Group performed an Extracorporeal shockwave  Lithotripsy to break up the stone.  Although they said the procedure was successful, breaking the stone into two pieces, a day later only some gravel and a bee-bee size piece were expelled.  Although still no pain, two weeks later a follow-up X-ray revealed the stone was still 6,5mm and still stuck in my ureter.  Therefore, aside from pain of the procedure and a cost of $10,000, the Lithotripsy did very little, and the Urology Group then prescribed a more invasive procedure of using a laser to go inside and break it up.  Not looking forward to another procedure and encouraged by the many successful reviews, I ordered this product.  In addition to the Flowmax and drinking 2.5 liters of water per day with concentrated lemon juice, I have been taking it as prescribed for two weeks now, with no results whatsoever!  I was discouraged to hear that this company recently changed their ingredients and the reviews since then have been far less successful.  Unless the pain returns, I believe I will try to wait this out to see if it will eventually pass.  I will repost as this progresses, and hopefully share with all a success story, but for now, this product doesn't seem to help at all!  For the past week, I doubled down on the dosage, two in the morning two in the evening, still no results!",1,3,2024-04-10,,0,,,,,,,0,,,,,Worse than: lithotripsy,,,,,2 morning 2 evening,"7.5mm, 6.5mm stones",,,,,,,,,1,,,,492,LLM

Since then, my attacks have gotten worse and worse. They used to last 15 to 30 minutes, and now they prolong for hours. So bad - I can expect to be out of commission for at least two days. But the thing of it is I don't want surgery and was trying to find any natural way to help dissolve my gallstones. By researching, I happen to come across Stonebreaker by Chanca Piedra. I read all the positive comments on this thread and decided why not. I gave it a go.I've taken these pills for the last 3 days. Morning and night with water and with my meal. No symptoms. I was thankful for that cause I was scared lol. On the fourth day, I had a late lunch - my first meal of the day. I ate lunch and took my pill. (I had a salad). About two hours later, I’m not even sure what the heck went wrong but my back and right side were KILLING me. I almost mistook it for a gallbladder attack, but eventually noticed the pain was something else - Not my usual gallbladder area under my breast, but my right kidney area (wrapping around my back and side). The pain was so heavy, it stopped me in my tracks and my husband helped me to the bed.My husband helped me by applying a heating pad to my kidney area. Within an hour the intense pain subsided. But the dull ache was still there. That was Saturday. I'm typing this Tuesday night and I can't bend over, twist and turn certain ways without that same dull intense pull/ache. And this happened on the 4th day of taking these pills. Sitting for long periods of time HURTS. Anything that applies pressure to my right kidney side HURTS. The only way I don't feel uncomfortable is if I stand.  I have never ever had a problem with my kidneys. Never. But now it seems I do. I'm praying the pain will just go away, but I will be visiting a Doctor Thursday if it doesn't.I honestly thought I was going to feel something in my gallbladder since there are stones there and not in my kidney, but that was NOT the case. At least for me, it wasn't. I discontinued use of these pills and will be doing more heavy research on them. I encourage you to do the same. I see that this is a good product for some people, and I'm glad they were able to help the majority. I’m not sure what went wrong with me. Maybe not enough water? Not enough rest? I am a very healthy girl except for my stones. I exercise and love eating healthy (especially since 2019). So, I don't know. I just felt like I should share my story because I know what it's like to have gallstones and have no hope of curing them with doctors always ready to cut on you. You are desperate for a solution and ready to try anything – I know I was. I will try to update my condition soon. But in the meantime, if you consider this product, just make sure you do HEAVY research on it.

To start, I got word of this product from a youtube video, someone said that it worked very well also the reviews were outstanding.  However,my experience was very different. About 2 months ago I had my first gallbladder attack ,extremely painful and scary. I eat a very healthy whole foods diet prior, so taking this I figured would only aid in getting rid of any further attack or previous stones from not eating the best when I was younger. I bought my first bottle. Followed the instructions and for about 2 weeks, there was no pain, no sign of gallbladder attacks, I was convinced that this was the reason. I was so excited that I bought another bottle to have on hand before my first ran out. After 2 weeks of taking it,I was doubled over in severe pain. Worst pain of my life and nothing would take it away. After 2 days of chronic pain I was rushed to the ER where they told me I had a lodged stone, and pancreatitis due to the lodged stone. Worst pain you will ever feel! Also i was told that i would need my gallbladder removed immediately.  When removing my gallbladder a duct was clogged with what was described as sludge and mini stones. Now this could be a coincidence or this product was breaking up stuff and got it stuck in my duct causing all these issues. It is no joke when I say, take these with a risk. If stones are breaking rapidly they can cause a clog. I am all about natural products, but I fear this could do more harm than good. 2 bottles, waste of money. Would not recommend.  I need to get a refund. Good luck all.",1,49,2020-05-28,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"severe pain, pancreatitis",1,,,,299,LLM

I will try to be as detailed as I can be, and try to keep it short, sweet, and to the point.**Quick Facts & Helpful Tips:- My husband is 32 (first stone was at 22)- Unsure of what ""type"" of kidney stones he deals with- Has had 1 emergency surgical removal of a stone in the past- Has a VERY high pain tolerance- We do not have insurance & all medication is over-the-counterPrior to taking ""Stone Breaker"":- Was taking generic-brand regular acetaminophen for pain (did not help at all)- The pain was intense enough to bring him to tears and cause vomiting- Was unable to sleep for more than an hour or so at a time- Was unable to eat for days- Experienced irritability and increased stress levels- Had symptoms of this kidney stone for 7 days before ""Stone Breaker""- Drank a gallon of water and 1 cup of lemon juice every dayAfter starting ""Stone Breaker"":- Capsules have no flavor and do not leave an after-taste- Taking product with or without a meal made no difference for him- Started taking 2 generic-brand acetaminophen arthritis pain-killers as needed (works very well)- Drinks a gallon of water and 1 cup of lemon juice daily- 2 days after starting product, went down to 1 pain-killer as needed- Has to pee a whole lot more than before starting this product- Uses a heating pad for pain, and it helps a lot- Is able to eat and sleep more regularlyIt's only been 2 days since he started the product and 9 days since the symptoms began. He has not passed the stone yet. However, he is able to get through the day without puking or ending up on the ground in tears since he began taking the product. Keep in mind that the amount of help that this product has given him is unknown because he had started the process of water and lemon juice 5 days prior to the product. Those two things are what they recommend to help with passing a stone, but there is a clear difference since starting the product.

I also drank probably 150oz of water daily from the beginning and mixed in lemon juice here and there.

Th family doctor said it was 'muscular-skeletal' but I talked him into giving me an MRI.  This showed the Kidney stones - two of them, slightly smaller than a pair of dice.He did not have any easy solutions for me - surgery would be very expensive.  So I went to a naturalist who recommended Magnesium tablets, which I took for about two weeks.  I did not sense any results, so I started hunting for something else on the web, and found these on Amazon.  Along with the Magnesium tablets, I started taking these tablets (or maybe they were capsules - I do not remember) twice a day.  This worked.  After about a week of taking these twice a day with about 8 oz of water, the stone passed, relatively painlessly.  The only problem was the the pills seemed to cause bouts with sudden, unexpected, and almost uncontrollable diarrhea. This started the third day, I think.This was still vastly preferable to other ways of dealing with the stones, and the pills may not have this effect on you.  I have no way of knowing.

The doctor came back in the room and said he was going to prep me for surgery again I was pumped up with morphine no pain thought I would just go home and investigate further as far as homeopathic cures then I stumbled across this chanca Piedra which as I understand translates to stonebraker figured for $30 what did I have to lose. So I took two a day for about 4 weeks had no flare-ups stop taking them for a while had a flare up Fourth of July 2018 at a barbecue on my way home became nauseous threw up when I got to my driveway got in the house took two capsules lay down and literally within 15 minutes felt completely fine I have  had a few other flare-ups in the meantime and I always carry a few of these with me every single time I have had one I popped two of these and pain is gone don't know why the doctors don't recommend this before surgery but I feel like it's a miracle cure.Update: Okay so I had another gallstone attack yesterday (9-27-18) at 4 am I woke up with a slight pain and got up immediately and took two caps. NOTHING! Pain increased to the point after 4 hours I was taken to the emergency room again to get Morphine. I probably shouldn't have eaten the three greasy tacos late the night before. I am going to get back to taking one every day to see what happens and stay away from the grease as much as possible. I will update in a few months to see how it goes.

He was diagnosed with kidney stones, one on the right side and another on the left. The one on the right was too big to pass so he wanted to go ahead with the lithotripsy procedure (breaking up the stones). The procedure was a success, stone on the right was broke up and gone. I went ahead and ordered the stone breaker in hopes to avoid this procedure on the left kidney stone. He went back on 6-11-18 for check up. The left stone was still there but he had only been taking stone breaker for a couple of days.  He is taking it on a regular basis now. He goes back in a few months to have another look . I hope the stone is gone. I will certainly update my review at that point.  He's not hurting right now so I'm thinking the stone breaker is helping.

I waited another week and then went to the ER (I don’t have a regular doctor and this is beyond urgent care). Turns out I had a 6mm gallstone blocking my bile duct. But I wasn’t in real pain, just moderately uncomfortable (although sustained discomfort takes a toll, too). I ended up having to have my gallbladder removed but I am pretty sure it was Stonebreaker that kept me from the excruciating pain I should have, by all rights, been in. I gave it 4 stars only because this is obviously anecdotal and it may not have been the reason for my lack of pain.

I hope my review will bring you hope if you are struggling with kidney stones.It started in the summer of 2022 when I was 4 months pregnant. At the time, it was UTI like symptoms. Due to my pregnancy, I was unable to take any type of herbal supplements I was just given pain medication. I dealt with the intolerable pain for two months and when I was 6 months pregnant I had emergency removal of 2 stones one on each side- 0.5mm and 0.8mm following stent placement for a week and stent removal and yes- that felt like I was giving birth. MRI performed before the removal of the stones showed I had 2 smaller stones on each kidney which were not removed during the procedure.Fast forward a year later- July 2023 I started with UTI like symptoms once again. I knew right away they were the kidney stones. I went to my urologist to test for a UTI and she confirmed there was indeed blood in urine confirming stones. I decided to try this product as it was my only and last hope as I was preparing myself for yet another removal procedure and financial strain on my savings. Ordered on Sunday night, product arrived on Tuesday and took as followed:1. Tuesday night- I had excruciating pain (pain level 9). It got worse when I took a glass with lime. Flank pain started and I took two supplements. Thirty minutes later I had very little to no urine and my bladder was hurting. I was debating whether to go to the ER. About 45 min into the pain I felt sharp pinching as the stone was moving down my urethra. Immediately after the sharp pinching feeling I was able to urinate.  Pain diminished slowly and was able to rest for the night.2. Wednesday morning- While fasting as soon as I woke up I took another glass with lime and added apple cider vinegar. I took one supplement with it. I was feeling ok throughout the morning with mild UTI like burning symptoms. By the afternoon after having some lunch, I had another glass with lime and apple cider vinegar. My pain increased to sharp pinching feeling in my urethra and pressure. I knew the stone was there and was a matter of time before I urinated it out. About an hour into my pain when laying down the sharp feeling intensified and all of a sudden it was gone- instant relief?! I ran to the restroom I heard a clank on the toilet bowl and there it was the stone!I will continue to take this to hopefully dissolve the others out. I highly recommend this product along with taking it with lime water and apple cider vinegar. I hope to never look back on kidney stone surgery removal and I hope you never have to go through that.

Stones form in the liver and make there way to the gallbladder and they will only show up on a ultrasound or X-ray if they are calcified. Stones can be big or small and feel like a lump of clay. They are green tan or white. Depending on how old  they are white are the newest formed tan then green are older. Green is the colour of liver bile and what gives your poop the brown colours. You can also have chaff which is a gritty sludge and looks like bits of rice. Stress Fungus parasites built up in the body can clog the pipes. The liver is your filter of cholesterol old hormones old blood cells etc etc so when its clogged up you will be tired, cranky,  weird hungry pains.

Started his Friday night thru Sat evening and late Saturday night he passed (see pic) a lot of what we term as “gravel”. Of course instant relief. I had him finish the supplement and then boom, the pain began again. Ordered another bottle, saw the doctor and got another CTScan which said the 3mm stone was descending down the ureter. Got the bottle of supplement Thursday and started him on them immediately. Saturday afternoon he comes out of the bathroom (didn’t screen) and says “I think I just passed 2 stones”  I didn’t get to see them but I did see the next sample with blood clots so I figured he did and all his pain was gone.

I’m on pain killers…Arrived smashed! Thanks! Lol! Whatever! I’m in pain. I don’t care.I took this tea, 2 bags steeped for 5 minutes in one cup about 25 minutes ago!At emergency I was told I have one 6mm stone that just left the kidney.Yesterday, I got another x-ray to see if it moved, but my doctor apparently is too busy to read it and tell me the results for 3 days. Maybe more. Too busy I guess.The x-ray tech and I clearly see 2 stones. One in kidney and one in the bladder? Did it break? Did they not see one in the CT scan. The urologist hasn’t told me, because he apparently is too busy.My bladder is totally reacting to this! I never heard so many noises in my bladder.I’m scared, but I don’t trust the Dr. and he has never even had a stone. He couldn’t care less. I trust the actual results of people who have taken this more than I trust him. I trust these reviews more than I trust him, because he doesn’t care.I was in emergency 8 days ago in the most excruciating pain of my life. They helped me and gave me the medications listed. I hope it’s okay to take this tea with those medications. I’m also taking:Flomax/TamsulosinNaproxen 500 mgHydrocodone-AcetaminI 100% feel my kidney is now making noises since I drank this tea! It’s such a weird feeling. I will update you soon. We will see… I kind of feel like drinking more! This is DEFINITELY doing something because I can actually hear it and feel it!!!————UPDATE————12/29/2023I cannot even express how grateful I am to God that this tea saved me from the worst pain of my life, along with medication listed above. I no longer feel pain and I will eventually go back and get another x-ray, but I need a break from Dr. now. I also got a better urologist that does not ignore me. I love this tea and drink it daily.

I’ve been in the emergency room four times, and a week ago my kidney decided to let loose the largest kidney stone I’ve ever had. The CT scan measured it at 5.2 mm, and my doctor said if I didn’t pass it in a week I needed to schedule lithotripsy. He didn’t think I could do it myself. I have been doing everything. I’ve been taking herbs, drinking water and coconut water, taking homeopathy, etc. I’ve taken Chanca Piedra in various forms for years, including capsules and tinctures. In a moment of desperation, I ordered this tea. It arrived yesterday afternoon, and I had one mug full of it. Immediately, I noticed a very relaxing feeling come over me and the pain decreased a little bit. I felt more myself last night than I have in the past week, and I finally felt hope that I would be ok. About 24 hours later, I painlessly peed this stone out. You can’t tell from the pictures, but it is smaller than the 5.2 mm the hospital said it was. It’s also smooth (I’ve passed several that had huge teeth). I doubt this tea is solely responsible for me passing the stone, but I know it played a huge part.

One after another after another. So the next morning i had 1 tea bag. It kept going. I can still feel it's large and angry. I kept drinking 1 tea bag 3 times a day despite being in agonizing pain. I was crying and just wanted to stop. But I pushed through. Finally the pain of stone passing stopped. But it wasn't over, i still have a large gallbladder filled with sludge.

A real pain pill not Excedrine etc.  In 20 min or so you will feel an uncomfortable feeling that will get even worse. When you can’t stand the pain take the pain pill and drink lots of water. When you have to “go” push hard and both times I did this my stream went from not much to a normal stream. Keep drinking water to see if you can pass anymore.

A year ago it was 5 mm. Then he told me that it had grown in size and that I would now need surgery. I absolutely did not wanna do surgery but the size of the stone was too big to pass so I thought I would give this product a try. I had only taken  One full bottle which I think lasted me A little over a month. I only took it one to two times a day if I could remember. I was also taking fulvic acid as a friend recommended that to me saying that that dissolved her kidney stone. Honestly I was so scared to take this because I thought if it broke it up in pieces then I would have several stones I would have to pass and I didn’t wanna go through that pain either so I was beyond scared but I thought I’ll do it anyway. Today I went to the hospital for a different reason but they did a kidney scan my 10 mm stone is now only 2 mm. I am blown away I can’t believe it I am so excited and happy . I am going to get another bottle and keep taking it. I’m not sure if it was a combination of both things I was taking or this alone.

I also found that I could buy it from the closest Natur-thyme grocery store in Dewitt, NY.  The first time I bought and used a small bottle of it was a month before I was scheduled for a KUB, sonogram and my next urologist appointment.  Mind you, I've had high blood pressure since 1980, and been under doctors' care with a urologist, plus a nephrologist ( 5 years).  I also had lithotripsy twice, which broke up the largest stones somewhat, but that's about all it did.  I've maintained a low oxalate diet, plus 64+ oz. of water with lemon juice, especially since retiring in in 2006.  Nothing was stopping the slow growth of kidney stones or the gradual rise of blood pressure.  Finally, after using this as directed for a month, the tests showed the stones were decreasing.  I never felt anything pass, although for the first time ever I had seen 'gravel' after urinating.  So I've continued taking it sporadically for 3 years.  Since January, Natur-Thyme has been back ordered on this product for several months.  I found it on-line, and am trying to stick to a 15 weeks regime.

When I shared with a co-worker that I was in the midst of passing another stone .. he told me about these Chanca Piedra drops.. Luckily Vitamin Shoppe had them in stock ( alot more expensive) and I began treating myself immediately. One droplet in a bottle of water every hour on the hour. 5 hours later I passed the larger of the stones around 5+ in size. Being that I have always gotten them what surprised me was how round and smooth it was compared to others.So I have remained on this stuff and passed another two plus several small ones. As someone has has even gotten surgery for kidney stones .. I can tell you THIS STUFF WORKS! I now but the 4 ounce bottle here cause it's super cheap!

I had my first kidney stone last year. It wouldn't pass on its own and the pain was unbearable so I underwent outpatient surgery to remove it, ending up with a stent for a week afterwards - very uncomfortable. When my doctor found 2 kidney stones in my other kidney 8 months later I started researching alternate treatments, and found Chanca Piedra. Given all the glowing reviews, I bought some. My Doctor had me scheduled for outpatient sonic wave procedure to break up my stones so they could pass on their own. I took Chanca tablets 3 times per day for the two weeks prior to the outpatient procedure, and I was sure based on the reviews that they would work. They didn't. They had zero affect on my stones. While in for the sonic procedure, I looked at the live X-ray before going under and saw two, whole, hard as rock stones in my kidney. Chanca did nothing. I wasn't expecting the stones to be gone, but I was expecting to see some evidence of breakup. Nothing. Waste of time and money.

But I had to be honest and give this product  1 star due  to my body's reaction to it.I took it as directed andUnfortunately this  chanca piedra product caused me terrible stomach cramps and diarrhea.I took it on different days and each time it effected me.I stopped taking it yesterday and the diarrhea ceased though stomach is still irritated and having mild discomfort.It is  a shame as I was hoping  this product would help rid my  kidney stone but it caused me side effects badly  enough for me  to discontinue taking it. And so I will have to find something else and continue drinking water to flush it out.  I will put some lemon juice in my water as I hear that may help.It looks like some people can tolerate chanca piedra  and not have gastric upsets but others like myself are sensitive to it.I would caution anyone trying this for the first time to stay close to home and a bathroom  just in case it effects you in the same way as it did me.You certainly do not want to be at work or out on a date or out driving or out  shopping and you get hit with stomach cramps and in urgent need of a bathroom.  That would be rough.You maybe lucky and it'll be fine and it could may even help your kidney stone situation. Who knows.

Maybe I have a type of stone that needs to be treated with another herb, or maybe is not a stone. Time will tell. However, I brother had kidney stones in the past and he treated it with chancapiedra and it worked for him.  Today I started to take a combination of ginger, turmeric and holy basil herbs to substitute the intake of alieve (I don’t want to destroy my stomach with high dosage analgesics) and it is helping with the pain.

I heard clinkers hit the bowl. My back has not felt this good for before I hurt my back. Thank you doctors for not thinking this could be an issue. Felt some pain in my right side again the other day took two a the pain subsided. It worked for me and I hope it works for you. Update- I would guess I have used half the bottle 1 at a time when my urine stream gets weak. Anyway been noticing weak stream and felt that twinge in my back and I’m like oh no. So anyway I was bending and doing heavy trailer lifting. Like real heavy and then pain came back and think I pulled muscles in my back… so here is the test I took 2 pills in literally in 1 hour- I got gas and my back pain is almost gone where I can walk again.

I took two. 1/2 hr pain went I’m like cool. Another half hour my groan hurt like someone was squeezing my -you know- I’m like I gotta go to hospital. I start driving and bam. My junk felt like it was on fire and had to go bathroom. I turned around made to bathroom and excreted the bloodiest brownish mixture I ever seen.

I’ve had two surgeries in the past on stones and did not want to go through that again.  My first symptom was the flank pain in my back and I knew it was happening again. Ugh.  I waited quite awhile for it to come down in my ureter and then the pain started. Renal colic is the worst!  I landed in the emergency room and was happy to hear it was a 3.5mm stone with two smaller stones still in my left kidney.  I read the reviews on Amazon and have heard of this natural method actually helping people.  So I took the Chanca Pietdra according to bottle instructions and within 7 days, I passed my stone without any drama what’s so ever!  At first, I was feeling tiny particles when i urinated and I didn’t think anything of it.  What actually happens is the Chanca Piedra breaks it down into small sandy particles making it smaller to pass.  I figured that out when i started to strain my urine and one morning PLOP! Out it came!!!  I did it without surgery!!!  Also, a few tablespoons of vinegar water ,and honey helped along with drinking fresh lemon water sped it along.  I still had to take something for the pain when it was in the ureter, but this product helped to make having a kidney stone manageable.  I believe i get kidney stones from taking antihistamines for my allergies s and NOT drinking enough water.  I ordered the Chanca Piedra tea to drink once a day to ward off the evil stones.  Plus, I’m mindful of drinking my tons of water a day with a little fresh lemon juice.

This product absolutely worked for me.  A 65 year old male diagnosed with a 6 mm kidney stone entering ureter on left side by CT scan.  First time in my life that I experienced this type of pain.  Couldn’t sit, stand, lay down, nothing would ease the pain.  I was prescribed pain meds by the urologist and told I hade a 50/50 chance of passing the stone.  He told me to make a follow up appointment in 30 days to reassess the situation.My daughter did some on-line research for me and found this product.  We were impressed with the many positive reviews and ratings.  Faced with the proposition of being in pain for at least 30 more days and having to possibly go through other medical procedures to blast it or extract it, I figured what did I have to lose by trying Chanca Piedra.  I took two pills twice a day for eight days before passing the stone with no issue.  The pain meds helped me manage the pain while giving Chanca Piedra time to work.  I also took flowmax as directed by doctor, and 2 capsules of apple cider vinegar daily (I decided to add this on my own) and I drank lots of water.  All of this, coupled with God’s answer to my prayers, got me out of pain, out of this situation, and back to normal.A couple sandlike particles appeared in the toilet bowl 2 or 3 urinations prior to passing the big one - a 6mm diameter soft dark brown  deflated pea-shaped membrane that shot out while peeing with no pain or issue.

He can take this routinely, or he can take a medicine prescribed by his health care physician.  He says that this supplement reduces episodes, and that he feels better when he takes it.As to the science, it holds up.

Less uric acid, less gout.My husband took this for a month to see a difference.  Now he asks me to re-order it when he is running low.

I took two pills twice a day with food and I drank lots of Water. Had my ct scan 10 days later and no kidney stone to be seen.

I did not want pills, as they always contain excipient ingredients. Unlike lite salt (which also contains potassium) this is a bulk product that contains no sodium. Great!Also, its citrate has two side side benefits:1) Citrate intake helps to prevent the most common type of kidney stone.2) Citrates inhibit an enzyme that supports one stage of glycolysis, making them useful in reduction of high blood sugar levels.My visual inspection of the powder I received showed no clumping. That testifies to the thorough sealing and air tightness of its packaging, because potassium citrate is very hygroscopic. I looked for obvious contamination, but saw no foreign matter in it. And it dissolved readily in filtered tap water.Potassium citrate formula : C6H5K3O7So there are 3 atoms of K per molecule of potassium citrate.Thus, potassium citrate is comprised of (3×39) / 306 = 38% potassium (K)With my AWS model AC-100 100 gram digital scale I measured a ¼ US cup volume of Bulk Supplements Potassium Citrate granules to be 63 grams. Since ¼ US cup = 12 US tsp, and the USA adult DV of K is 4700 mg, we have for this supplement :½ tsp = 2625 mg C6H5K3O7; 998 mg K; 21% DV1 tsp = 5250 mg C6H5K3O7; 1995 mg K; 42% DV2 tsp = 10,500 mg C6H5K3O7; 3990 mg K; 85% DV3 ¼ tsp = 17,053 mg C6H5K3O7; 6480 mg K; 138% DVSo the 275 mg serving ( which is only 0.05 tsp ) labeled on this powder's Supplement Facts is insignificantly small. That dose provides only 2% USA adult DV, which is incorrectly labeled as a 3% DV for K. The next richest supplementary source of K ( to this citrate powder ) is Morton Lite Salt, but 2 US tsp of it would be required daily in order to get 80% DV of K, and that would mean an intake of 96% of the sodium DV.TIPSIn general, American adults are recommended to get at least 4,700 mg (100% DV) of potassium daily, while limiting daily sodium to 1,500 mg.  But most Americans are not meeting either goal. See the two USDA reports: 'Potassium Intake of the U.S. Population' and 'Sodium Intake of the U.S. Population'. Perhaps the U.S. National Library of Medicine has set the potassium DV absurdly high? The Austrailian Ministry of Health has set their adult men's DV at 81% as high as the USA's, and their adult women's DV is only 60% as high as the USA's.The richest dietary source of potassium (K) is not a banana, but chard. However, it is extremely high in oxalate. A baked potato (with skin), is richer in K than a banana, but one would have to consume five of them per day in order to obtain 100% of the USA adult DV of K !Extended release potassium citrate tablets are prescribed as a long term therapy for treating calcium oxalate kidney stones. The daily intake of those tablets totals 6400 mg as four equally spaced doses. These patients are also advised to restrict their dietary oxalate intake, while increasing their intake of water.CAUTIONThere is a purity issue with this Chinese product. Bulk Supplements did not provide a certificate of analysis with the package. That should be a document prepared by an independent 3rd party.

I think it is maybe a combo of the two or the rowatinex making the bigger difference of the two. I was taking lasik and the dr changed to indapamide instead to help not get kidney stones.When starting I had 5 stones in each kidney  biggest being 9mm. After a year taking 3 rowatinex twice a day and the indapamide, I went for exam and I had none in left kidney and several in right all 5mm or less. I have had totally different readings within a week of each other so it is alway hard to trust the competence of technicians. The 2nd year I went in and only had some tiny tiny stones. I decreased my rowitinex to 2 twice a day because it seemed alot I was taking and it is expensive. 3rd year, I was hoping for no sign of stones but there were several in right and one is 6mm. Did decrease in what I was taking in rowatinex make that difference? Not sure on that.My conclusion is that it must be helping, but it is not an instant acting fix for while you are passing a stone. Over the last 3 years I have had kidney stone pain and I chug water while constantly walking and pacing. The stone usually passed or subsided within an hour of doing this. Before starting  on rowatinex, I was having to have lithotripsy every 6 months to a year.I could stop taking it and only take the indapamide to test this but I don't want to risk getting enormous stones i can't pass to test this theory. Right now I will continue with regimen.I heard about rowatinex because a friend was in Germany and passed a stone and the hospital gave her the rowatinex to prevent stones.

I had a 7x6x4mm stone stuck at the very bottom of my ureter.  I live in the middle of nowhere in the mountains of Guatemala, and the quality of medical care here is iffy at best.  It took them three months to even figure out what was wrong with me, but finally they got a good, clear scan and someone who could read it.  The doctor told me that since the ureter narrows at the junction with the bladder, it was highly unlikely I would ever pass this stone and was doing damage to my kidney by leaving it there.  He wanted to do a ureteroscopy, remove the stone, and put in a stent.  I'd heard awful things about those stents and wasn't too thrilled to get such an invasive procedure done down here in the boonies, so I put him off for weeks.  I heard about Rowatinex from a pharmacist here and decided to stop taking the Flomax (made me dizzy) and try this instead.  I took 2 pills Sunday night, 2 pills 3x on Monday, and passed the stone this morning before I even had a chance to take the pills.  Best part is that I passed it with zero pain!  In fact, if I hadn't been using a strainer, I wouldn't have even known I passed it.  I did not have any side effects at all.

Since I'm the family vet tech, I took the little girl everywhere for assessment and suggestions. Diet, medicine, water changes...nothing worked very well and the stones would periodically recur. Also, often when we tested the urine we would get results of crystals in it. At some point, my mom went on an extended trip to Europe to visit relatives and saw a German vet there just for a checkup. The lady suggested this product. Since then, the little dog has had significantly decreased recurrence of crystals in her urine. Important: this product hasn't removed the urinary troubles completely, but it has worked in addition to all the other things we do for her (diet, low Ph water, occasional treatment) to keep the stones from actually forming. It DOES appear to be a useful supplement, but like anything else, I do not believe it is a miracle cure, and I do not know if drinking cranberry daily would have the same effect. However, you try to get a dog to drink cranberry juice (or me, for that matter)! This thing has worked as well as expected, and a bit better. Now, in all fairness, it works for a dog. I have to imagine it works for humans in the same fashion, when combined with sensible diet, but that's MY OWN assessment.",4,2,2014-05-07,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rowatinex,,,1,,,,235,LLM
