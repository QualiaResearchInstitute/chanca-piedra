Potassium citrate,BulkSupplements.com Potassium Citrate Powder,E. Shulman,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2020",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My doctor prescribed Potassium Citrate tablets to help prevent future kidney stones, since I have a history of getting these. For some reason, however, this drug is classified as a category 4 drug by my prescription drug plan, which makes  the copay quite costly. Doing some additional research I discovered that all Medicare Part D drug plans classify this drug as a category 4. However, the pills they prescribe are nothing more than a time released tablet of Potassium Citrate, the same exact substance that is in the BulkSupplements bag. So, I have been using the BulkSupplements Potassium Citrate, measured on a cheap ($20) scale in grams, for over a year with great results. My doctor has given this his full approval and all of my test results have been great. He is now recommending this instead of the expensive pills to his patients.",7 people found this helpful,Size: 2.2 Pound (Pack of 1)

Potassium citrate,BulkSupplements.com Potassium Citrate Powder,Barney,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2017",true,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered it as a supplemental source of potassium. I did not want pills, as they always contain excipient ingredients. Unlike lite salt (which also contains potassium) this is a bulk product that contains no sodium. Great!Also, its citrate has two side side benefits:1) Citrate intake helps to prevent the most common type of kidney stone.2) Citrates inhibit an enzyme that supports one stage of glycolysis, making them useful in reduction of high blood sugar levels.My visual inspection of the powder I received showed no clumping. That testifies to the thorough sealing and air tightness of its packaging, because potassium citrate is very hygroscopic. I looked for obvious contamination, but saw no foreign matter in it. And it dissolved readily in filtered tap water.Potassium citrate formula : C6H5K3O7So there are 3 atoms of K per molecule of potassium citrate.Thus, potassium citrate is comprised of (3×39) / 306 = 38% potassium (K)With my AWS model AC-100 100 gram digital scale I measured a ¼ US cup volume of Bulk Supplements Potassium Citrate granules to be 63 grams. Since ¼ US cup = 12 US tsp, and the USA adult DV of K is 4700 mg, we have for this supplement :½ tsp = 2625 mg C6H5K3O7; 998 mg K; 21% DV1 tsp = 5250 mg C6H5K3O7; 1995 mg K; 42% DV2 tsp = 10,500 mg C6H5K3O7; 3990 mg K; 85% DV3 ¼ tsp = 17,053 mg C6H5K3O7; 6480 mg K; 138% DVSo the 275 mg serving ( which is only 0.05 tsp ) labeled on this powder's Supplement Facts is insignificantly small. That dose provides only 2% USA adult DV, which is incorrectly labeled as a 3% DV for K. The next richest supplementary source of K ( to this citrate powder ) is Morton Lite Salt, but 2 US tsp of it would be required daily in order to get 80% DV of K, and that would mean an intake of 96% of the sodium DV.TIPSIn general, American adults are recommended to get at least 4,700 mg (100% DV) of potassium daily, while limiting daily sodium to 1,500 mg.  But most Americans are not meeting either goal. See the two USDA reports: 'Potassium Intake of the U.S. Population' and 'Sodium Intake of the U.S. Population'. Perhaps the U.S. National Library of Medicine has set the potassium DV absurdly high? The Austrailian Ministry of Health has set their adult men's DV at 81% as high as the USA's, and their adult women's DV is only 60% as high as the USA's.The richest dietary source of potassium (K) is not a banana, but chard. However, it is extremely high in oxalate. A baked potato (with skin), is richer in K than a banana, but one would have to consume five of them per day in order to obtain 100% of the USA adult DV of K !Extended release potassium citrate tablets are prescribed as a long term therapy for treating calcium oxalate kidney stones. The daily intake of those tablets totals 6400 mg as four equally spaced doses. These patients are also advised to restrict their dietary oxalate intake, while increasing their intake of water.CAUTIONThere is a purity issue with this Chinese product. Bulk Supplements did not provide a certificate of analysis with the package. That should be a document prepared by an independent 3rd party. Had they provided an acceptable report I would've given this product a 5-star rating.",63 people found this helpful,Size: 2.2 Pound (Pack of 1)

The attack only lasted a week and I haven't had one since, but I do not ever want to experience one again.  Now this is internet science, so take it for what it's worth, but I've read that potassium citrate helps dissolve both uric acid and calcium oxalate so that it is excreted through the urine as opposed to ending up in your bloodstream and settling in your joints and/or forming accretions in your bladder/ureter/kidneys.  I haven't conferred with any physicians to get their two cents on the issue, but I'm hoping that by adding a small amount of this product to my diet, I won't need to see any doctors to treat or diagnose either ailment in the first place.

Too many of the supplements I've been purchasing are coming in bottles and that's just unnecessary room that it's taking up. Because I've only recently started using it, I can't say for sure how good it's effectiveness is so far but I can say that there haven't been any adverse effects which is always a plus.I look forward to purchasing from BulkSupplements in future for my supplemental needs.",2 people found this helpful,

Potassium citrate,BulkSupplements.com Potassium Citrate Powder,DanielH,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2014",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Highly satisfied with this- it dissolves instantly in water.  I've got a specific kidney stone disease that requires me to drink excess water (a couple gallons a day) and to take the citrate form of Potassium to help them not form.  In the amounts i have to use, i still can't taste much of a taste in the water.  (i don't mix it in with any food or anything, but you easily could).  Suggestions- this is a highly hygroscopic substance-  if you leave the bag open, it will suck humidity out of the air and begin to solidify- so be sure to keep it sealed in the original sturdy bag or another similar VERY airtight bag.",19 people found this helpful,Size: 8.8 Ounce (Pack of 1)
