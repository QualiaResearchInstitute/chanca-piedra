Chanca Piedra,SLOsurfer,35-44,less than 1 month,Other,2024-02-04,5,5,5,5,"Incredible. I am a skeptic and a scientist by training, so naturally I don't believe something like this could work, but with so many positive reviews, I had to try it. Two weeks ago I started passing my 3rd stone ever. The first two came out after hours of pain years ago, but this one got stuck in my ureter for almost two weeks. I took chanca piedra (bought through Amazon from Eu Natural Store), 2 capsules, 1200mg, once a day. Within exactly 48 hours, my stone was out. The first day I noticed what looked like fresh blood clot materials (floating) coming out and maybe some bits of sand. The second day I had what looked like old blood clot materials (little black discs slowly sinking) coming out, sometimes bits of sand, and then finally the whole 4mm stone (sank like rock). I am incredibly impressed by this product and am so relieved to have it out. It's certainly worth a try if you're suffering from kidney stones. I'm going to keep taking it for a couple weeks and see if the other stones sitting in my kidneys come out.",1,1

Chanca Piedra,PattyPoo1234,45-54,less than 1 month,Gallstones,2023-11-18,3,3,3,3,"I just started taking this to see if it will help me with gallstones. I don't know if it will yet. I will come back and report if it does. I was having kidney stone problem. It was caused from hyperparathyroidism. Body making to much calcium. I advise anyone making large amounts of kidney stones or even just one to have pth and calcium levels checked. I had a fluctuating calcium level so I was hard to diagnose. I used my gut feeling and went to Norman Parathyroid Center in Florida and sure enough I had a large tumor on my parathyroid. I had one parathyroid removed. A lot of doctors ignore a high calcium level or recheck and it's normal the next time so they think you don't have a problem when you do. The truth is it can be fluctuating and causing you to have a kidney stone problem. Have your calcium and pth checked a few times not just a couple and see where it is. If you are over 40 and your calcium level is over 10, you are having issues. Your calcium level for your age should be 9-9.5 never over 10. Quit suffering and take the bull by it's horns and take care of the main problem. ",1,1

After exactly 14 days of taking approximately 800mg 3Ã per day, on morning of October 23rd, I collected a significant amount of sand like grit that when compacted to several millimeters of material. Only kidney imaging can confirm the Stones are gone or reduced in size. But I am very confident that Chanca Piedra is having a major effect on resolving my habitual kidney stone issues.

A bit of advice I read on another site was make sure you buy legitimate Chanca. Some online vendors might not be selling true product. We were able to buy the Chanca at a local health food store and the brand they had available was Whole World Botanicals (I paid for that product and am not being paid to mention that name). 400 mg capsules. 

The guy at the health food store mentioned the tea wouldn't be strong enough. I don't know if that's true, some ppl on these reviews said they used the tea with good results, but that was his opinion [and he had experience with stones]. Maybe it depends on the strength of it?

I drink lots of liquids (about 1.5 gallons a day) to help keep the stones at a minimum but I still have lots of stones.  Started taking Chanca Piedra and it has helped me with pain.  I always have stones so I have to wait to have another test to see if it has reduced any stones in size or quantity but it does help my pain and it seems to make me void more, which could also help people with high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes.

On Dec 2019, One morning I did a bloody pee and I heard a clink in the toilet bowl, so I put on a glove and picked a 7 mm stone. The pain so unbearable . I started googling about kidney stones and I found that Chanca Piedra and Apple cider can help dissolve the stones. I found a local store that carried the product and I  bought it and also a bottle of Apple cider vinegar already mixed with honey and turmeric and I took them right away. The next day and for the following next 2 weeks, I was passing stones , 3 or 2 at time. I was able to recover 8 stones, some I could not because I was in public restrooms. It worked for me. I still take one a day to maintain, because almost what you eat are no good for kidney stones. Phosphorus and potassium are big no no, so I try to limit food that contains those.

Chanca Piedra,,45-54,1 to less than 2 years,Other,2020-02-16,5,5,5,5,"I am a 48 year old male and i've had stones since i was in 2nd grade. I've probably passed a hundred stones in my lifetime from the size of grain of sand to a small bullet. For the last ten years or so I generally did not have the agonizing pain associated with stones, but it was replaced with a dull ache that would linger for up to a month and would be triggered by any kind of physical activity. Even walking through the grocery store would set it off. I had a cat scan and it showed 'multiple' stones (generally meaning too many to count) and one very large one that was sitting right at the base of the kidney and potentially move around and block urinary flow. I was going to have lithotripsy again but the doctor was going to force me to have a stent which i don't need due to the size of the stones i've passed my whole life. I bought Stone Breaker off of Amazon and it has literally changed my life. I don't even take it every day, just when I start to feel any kind of burning, pain or any kind of disruption with my urine. I never passed any stone fragments and my urine did not appear cloudy as some of the reviews claimed. All I can say is that the lingering ache that plagued me for years is now gone. I can't believe it's a coincidence. Not sure if it changes the PH of my urine or what. I would be very curious to have another imaging of my kidneys done to see if that large stone is gone or has shrunk in size.

Recently I noticed similar pain to what I had in 03 and I went back to a daily dose and the pain disappeared.  Also, I am using it for gallbladder issues as well.

I found this out of desperation as it made me feel really sick to have so many stones. This stuff really works! Unfortunately because my body is producing stones so quickly in large amounts I'm not 100% clear of stones all the time but I'm still greatful because when I do have stones it's mostly 2 in each kidney and they are very very small. I'm constantly taking this stuff, if I stop I will start to feel really bad again.

Chanca Piedra,JB,35-44,less than 1 month,Other,2018-12-23,5,5,5,5,"I'm 39, and have a strong international  background. The reason I am telling this is because I can compare medicine and medical systems from different countries, and unfortunately, western medicine always tries to undermine natural medicine, specially in the US. Well, natural medicine was here for millenia, and what used to kill human beings were infections. Everything else was pretty much taken care of with natural medicine. I am not trying to diagnose or treat anyone here, just telling my experience. Chanca piedra works, it doesn't matter what some people say. It has worked for thousands of years. In my particular case, it dissolved and released all of my kidney stones. After 4 weeks of taking the pills my stones are gone for good. I struggled for almost three years thinking I had spine problems, chronical back pain, but no MRI could show any problem. I had no idea what it was. I was in pain. I had no energy. I came across a MD who also studied traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine for over a decade in Japan. He diagnosed me with kidneystones. He also told me to try chanca piedra tea for some weeks, and my pain was gone. The big stones where still there though. That's when he told me to take the herbal pills, which is basically the same plant I was drinking as tea, in pills. 4 weeks later, I had no stones. I can't even tell when I released them. I felt no pain during the processes, and I obviously feel no pain now. Great product, I recommend you take it.

I have been plagued by kidney stones for the past 4 years, when I was diagnosed with innumerable kidney stones in both kidneys.  In May 2018 I had surgery to remove 5 kidney stones that were embedded in my ureter.  When I went back for follow-up, I still had blood in my urine, so more tests (ultrasound, CAT scan, KUB).  Another stone; this one was 8 mm and also in my ureter.  I was not in pain, but the location of the stone was causing my kidney to enlarge, so my doctor determined it would have to be removed and scheduled my surgery for 10/23/18.  The stone had been in the same location for the previous 10 weeks, and wasn't moving at all.  The thought of going through the surgery (and the stent they insert afterwards) was enough to prompt me to start searching for any alternatives.  I came across chanca piedra.  I read so many reviews from people who claimed it worked that I figured I'd try it; I had nothing to lose except $30.  The product I bought was Stone Breaker by EU Natural (and if you are wondering, the answer is NO, I have not been paid to write this review; I've not been in contact with the company that sold it to me, and I paid full price). I took the first dose on Tuesday; taking 2 tablets twice a day.  On Sunday morning, I passed the stone.  I am still in shock.  I almost can't believe it myself.   It came out in 5 pieces, like it was literally broken up.  I know if something seems too good to be true, it usually is.  But I can state, in absolute honesty, unequivocably, that this stuff worked!

I had 4 small stones in my left kidney and one in my right remaining ranging from 3mm to about 5mm.    It was coming up to my yearly review with my doctor.  I had to have an abdominal X-ray prior to my appointment to see if the stones had grown.    So about 8 weeks prior to this I decided to try Chanca Piedra in powder form, which I mixed according to directions,  and drank as a cold tea.   I did this for two weeks.   During the two weeks my joints ached which I felt was a side effect of the mixture and I had occasional back pain, but I was determined to see the two weeks out.   Im so glad I did, as the X-ray showed ZERO stones.  Iâm thrilled to say the least!   Bear in mind that a plain X-ray is not as detailed as a scan however my doc said that if there were any stones remaining that they would be so insignificant (small) they wouldnât be a problem.

I went today and the results were the 6mm is gone and the 9mm and 4mm that were left in the kidneys are now only a few pieces that are 2-3mm in size. This worked better than I ever thought it would as I was just hoping it would get ride of the one 6mm stuck just outside the bladder. I am going to order more and take it for the next year as that is when I am to go back to the doctor and see if it gets rid of the 2-3mm pieces that are left. I would recommend this product to anyone with kidney stones and if you don't see results at first just keep taking it as it may take longer for different people as there stones may be different.,115,116

-Dose they recommend: Daily max. 50 drops, or 1.31 g of extract (1310 mg)
-Dose I used: Started with 15-20 drops twice a day, reduced to 5-8 drops once a day.
-Reasons for taking the tincture: Hormonal imbalance, anxiety, insomnia, to boost the immune system.
-My experience so far: The first days I took about 15-20 drops twice a day. My anxiety seemed to worsten about an hour after taking the tincture, this would luckily slowly fade away but I did feel foggy, a bit numbed and depressed and nauseous throughout the day (I almost never get nauseous, so this was strange to me). Positive thing was that I did sleep like a baby but the downside was that I had a really hard time getting out of bed in the mornings. 
So after a few days I decided tot lower the dosage to about 10 drops twice a day. The foggy and numbed feeling stayed and made me feel insecure about my daily tasks so I decided to only take the tincture before bedtime. The deep sleep was wonderful, but I kept feeling so tired in the morning, it took me hours to feel a bit alert and I didn't like the light feeling of nausea that I remained as well, so again I lowered the dosage to only 5-8 drops once a day (before sleep). 
This seemed to work for me, as I was sleeping alright (not as deep as with the higher dosage though). I didn't feel nauseous, although it did still reduce my appetite and my anxiety and feelings of light depression would fade as well. I seemed to function fine during the day and my symptoms of PMS seemed to decrease. In general I felt good with this dosage. Especially because it seemed to balance my hormones (no mood swings, no swollen glands before my period, no increased susceptibility to allergy). 
In the description of this tincture it says to stop using it after three weeks. I decided to stop for 2-3 weeks (reducing the dosage to only 3 drops the last 3 days). After this pause I will start again with the dosage of max 8 drops a day before sleep and see how that goes. At this moment I have stopped taking the tincture for four days and didn't notice any big withdrawal symptoms. Although unfortunately I do have some trouble with sleeping again. Because there are so many warnings about this plant medicine, along with soms really bad experiences, I'm rather careful with using it. The way it made me feel in the beginning also made me cautious.",0,0

The second week of April, I noticed some âgastrointestinalâ issues I had random nausea throughout that week. My appetite was disappearing and then the weekend of April 12. I had the most random panic attack. I have not had panic attacks in YEARS! And then thatâs when I started noticing heightening anxiety now I do have anxiety, but this was different. This was more intrusive anxiety! That Monday 4/15 I woke up SICK like if I was poisoned. Aggressive vomiting, nausea, shakes, elevated heart rate, feeling like my blood sugar was crashing. This was how I was that Monday though 4/19. I went to the ER because I didnât eat that week, I honestly felt like I was dying & my anxiety was the worse itâs been like it was just 24/7 & intrusive at that point. The ER told me I was severely dehydrated & kept monitoring my heart. I tried to convince him that maybe this was just all anxiety related, but they disagreed. They were concerned about my stomach and the symptoms I was experiencing they had to put me on a few IV bags. They didnât want to release me, but they wanted to see how I felt at home after medicating me and putting me on the IVs. But they did tell me to stop the supplement! I didnât think anything of it at the time I was like itâs a natural supplement shouldnât be an issue, but I was wrong. Unfortunately there is withdrawal symptoms and they can last weeks longer from all the thorough research.

Everyone's experience will be different according to their personal chemistry and the things they eat and so on. So it was that I thought about trying this ashwagandha with an open mind, as it claims to reduce stress and improve sleep. Of course, coming to WebMD, I checked out what people were saying both positive and negative. I remembered people reporting that they would have strange dreams and suicidal thoughts.

So it was very disturbing to me that the very first time I used it to calm down after I had a rather stressful day, in the middle of the night I woke up having a rather vivid and unusual dream. After waking up but still in bed, I thought of what might happen if something terrible happened and my mind got around to thinking of suicide! I don't think that way, so it stood out in my mind and then I remembered the reviews of ashwagandha that reported these very same symptoms!

It was just too much of a coincidence for me to write it off.  Coming back here, my memory was verified. In my older years, I've been checking out various supplements. Some of them are quite good! But it's very few that comes with a warning about these things and I just wanted to add my name to a list of people having these symptoms. 

I'm not saying this product might not work for everyone. Everyone's chemistry is different and it's possible that there are people who might gain benefit from this. I'm not one of them!

My satisfaction is somewhat lower than the effectiveness as though it clearly has a good effect on anxiety, it also decreases my desire to talk and share passionately â which I also love.

I took a powder from a health food store. Unfortunately it has taken me over a year to connect the dots and realize the ashwaghanda I incorporated into my natural treatments was then the culprit of some of the very symptoms I was trying to combat. Namely: low/no sex drive, being completely emotionally numb, extreme fatigue, debililtating brainfog. I will say it can lower anxiety, but along with this lowers my ability to feel any emotion at all and during acute stage I felt like a complete zombie, and had zero motivation. This affects so many hormones (is GABAergic, serotonergic, dopaminergic, affects your sex hormones, drastically lowers cortisol) The strong effect on all of this resulted in persistent and impactful imbalance eg: you really, really need cortisol..at the correct levels, to feel motivated and content emotionally) Yes I cycled it, and took half a teaspoon on the days I had it, a common recommendation. It wasn't til I restocked and commenced a new cycle nearly every day for 3 weeks (in January this year) that I noticed something was really, really wrong.. It does not work well with my, and many others' bodies. I have now been 2.5 months off so far and the extreme fatigue, brainfog, demotivation, and feeling dead inside have subsided (they were practically debilitating and I have lost a lot of my life to this supplement making me sick). I am becoming much more alert, my menstrual cycle is no longer extremely short like 21 days, I still can't feel all my emotions, nor is my sex drive working and that is significant, beyond having sex. Sexual energy is a life force, the feeling of embodiment. Whereas I am dissociated. I am 30 and know myself very, very well and this is distinctly an imbalance my body/brain are trying to recover from- my thoughts themselves are not negative. I literally can't feel my emotions. This really is not for everyone, please be careful and know that as an ayurvedic herb act very differently on each person depending on their energetic/biological make up and it would be best assessed and monitored by a qualified practitioner of herbal medicine.

I was interested in the stated results of reducing stress, anxiety, and increasing sexual function and testosterone support. I found Young Theory KSM-66 500mg capsules at my local Costco, though I had seen the Goji-brand gummies as well. I chose the capsule form as it better fits into my supplement routine. I would say it's been the better part of a year now, consuming most days out of the week on average, but aimed for daily consumption. I will say that I have noticed a pleasant increase in my libido, and certainly a reduction in my stress and anxiety, though not tremendous. I would consider this to be a supplement to mildly calm oneself through the day and help maintain a more level head. The best results I have seen in my time consuming is when I am stacking it with eating well most days out of the week, and occasional to regular exercise. I will add that I have not struggled with regular sickness as well, thanks to the added immune support. My only exception to this is when I became sick with COVID-19 at the height of the pandemic -- of course, I can't and won't speak to any of its effects with COVID-19 as there have not been any studies done as of today that can speak on its effectiveness to combat or prevent it. But in regard to the common cold, flu, etc, it has been incredibly effective at keeping me healthy day-to-day.
Reading some of the other reviews here, I've noticed an apparent trend that the folks that have taken Ashwagandha in gummy form have not had a great experience, so I'm unsure if different forms of the root have anything to do with its efficacy, but thought I would mention it if anyone can attest to this.
Ultimately, I have had a wonderful experience taking Ashwagandha and will continue to utilize it. My current primary form of consumption is through the BPN Super Greens powder, which contains 300mg of KSM-66 per serving, which is less than my average dose, but I do have the capsules with me in the event I feel as though I need to up my daily dose.

It does not raise my blood pressure. I take another one about 2 or 3 in the afternoon. That's when my stamina begins to fade. I take another. Get up and move around and again my mind and body are able to have the stamina I need for the rest of the day. I almost never need to take a nap every afternoon as I had to before. I find I snack less, especially on simple carbs, that my body gets craving since it thought that would give me more energy. I actually feel more like eating healthier.

I plan on continuing to take it and have incorporated it into a very detailed medication/ supplement regimen. I hope I can take it regularly. It's made all the difference in my life. ",0,1

I've not noticed any side effects after more than 1 year of daily use. I started in slowly at 1 cap per day and have increased to 3/day.

I know that cortisol tends to send the fat to the belly so I thought I'd give this a try.  The label states that it helps maintain normal cortisol levels, among other things.  I started taking it about 6 months ago and the weight has been steadily coming off.  I am on a program of monitoring the kinds of foods I eat and being aware of what drives me to eat.  Combined, I have lost about 40 pounds.  I ran out a while back and decided to see if it was really doing anything for me.  After about two weeks off of it I noticed my weight plateaued, which is normal during weight loss.  I continued to eat as I had been and after another week, I noticed fat building up around my waist.  My weight was still sitting at the same measure and I started to think that maybe the pills were helping me with it.  So, I recently bought more and after a week my weight started moving down again and my waistline is getting better.  The weight loss is at a healthy rate of about half to 3/4 of a pound weekly and I feel better knowing my weight is moving down again, as well as my clothes fitting better.  I haven't noticed any negative effects, perhaps because I make sure I take my meds on a full stomach.  I do take meds for hypothyroidism and depression so, after reading some of the reviews, am going to cut down to one tablet a day instead of two.  We'll see how that works. The brand I've been using is from Costco.  It's put out by ""youtheory"" in 500mg capsules. No bad taste or weird mental issues.",1,1

Ashwagandha,,25-34,1 to 6 months,Other,2021-07-24,5,5,5,5,"I've been using Ashwagandha for about 2 months now. I started off using the YouTheory brand and now I am using the Organic India one. Personally I've had great results in many aspects of my life using it. My main use for it was to enhance sexual performance and it hasn't disappointed yet! But I have also had other positive effects. Libido is higher, workouts feel easier, I am not as hungry as usual, and I've had less racing thoughts throughout the day. I take it daily but I only consume at most 400mg a day. I have a feeling that the people who have experienced the worst side effects are dosing too much too quickly. Our bodies are all different and some of us might require more and some might require less to achieve a great effect. It doesn't hurt to start off with a low dosage everyday and be consistent with that. I haven't experienced any negative side effects from it, the only one would be a temporary drowsiness for about an hour once I consumed it. Overall I am very pleased with this supplement and I will continue to use it daily unless I develop any adverse effects in the long-term. ",2,2

My normal meds just include blood pressure pill, birth control,  aderall and stuff for my acid reflux. I decided to give this a try. I take them at night before I go to bed. I suddenly hopped online today because I was feeling.....different. I went to bed great last night but woke up at 230 am and could not get back to sleep. I woke up extremely itchy also. After 4am I said screw it and got up since my alarm would go off at 5. I have been wired. My coworkers asked why I was so twitchy and wired, asked if I was ok. I told them I felt like I was on drugs and didn't know what was going on! I was sooooo fricken itchy! But other than all that, I have had zero anxiety or panic attacks within the last 48 hours. I feel overly focused. Im going to ride it out and see what I feel in a week. Ive also lost my appetite (im ok with that) but can tolerate healthy snacking. I will take this weird feeling over the panic attacks and anxiety so as of right now, Im a fan. I just wish I could stop itching! ",2,2
Ashwagandha,Ashwagandha,65-74,,Other,2021-07-12,2,1,4,1,"I popped a Spring Valley Ashwagandha Root Powder 800 mg tablet a few days ago. I have anxiety, depression, ADHD, PTSD and am on psychotropics for these conditions.  Within 3 hrs while shopping, I suddenly felt hot, broke out in a sweat, became nauseous, and w/out any control, threw up (which I had to hold in my mouth while getting to a bathroom).  Returned home just in time to throw up twice in my yard (back-to-back).  I felt very weak & sick, barely making it inside to the porcelain bowlâwhere I sat for >3 hrs alternating between puking & diarrhea.  I also couldnât think straight and my balance was off. I had ripped off my soaking wet clothes because my temperature regulation was off (hot).  Then toward the end of purging both ends, I became deeply chilled.  Drew a bubble bath, but my chills were so strong I had to re-up on the hot water; I felt so weak, after I toweled off, I used a heavy winter bathrobe for the chills, kinda stumbling around (my cats had waited 2 1/2 hrs to be fed).  Totally depleted of electrolytes after all thatâwhen I was suddenly overcome by thirst. Fortunately I had pediatric electrolyte popsicles from 5 yrs ago, where a series of vomiting episodes of unknown origin occurred.  By 11 pm, my stomach was hungry and I ate a small portion of mild food.  Iâm quite sure my body over-reacted as an overdose of Ashwagandha root powder; the product itself is Lab-Certified and distributed by WalMart. I spent the next day recovering (from the intensity of purging) and returned to normal the following day.  Iâm sure this dose was just too much for meâand all the glowing recommendations belie my experience.  I donât doubt that it helps multitudes of people. ",1,2

Ashwagandha,nmh9977,25-34,less than 1 month,Other,2020-12-07,2,1,4,1,"This review is for the product Organic Ashwagandha by the company Himalaya. From the label it contains: 380mg ashwagandha powder (root); 280mg ashwagandha extract (root); and 10mg ashwagandha supercritical CO2 extract. I read about ashwagandha as having a therapeutic effect on anxiety in a controlled study and I thought it might help me. It is also supposed to give energy and claims to have an effect on adrenal function. I have been previously diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder, and I suspect panic disorder as well. I am a 32 year old female at 120lbs, not on any medications, and I do not smoke, drink, or take illegal drugs. I followed the directions and took 1 caplet before food just before my dinner. I felt strange within just a few minutes, beginning with an unpleasant lightheaded sensation which startled me, and I began to feel panicky -- on a scale of 1 to 10, around a 7 or 8 in severity. It felt like I had drank about 3 or 4 cups of coffee at once. I am familiar with my anxiety levels and this was noticeably more intense. To be more precise I actually felt ""drugged."" It took 2 hours to come down from this feeling of panic with some deep breathing. I lost my appetite but I could still force myself to eat. It was a very uncomfortable experience for me. Currently, about 4 hours later, I still feel some effects -- slight but noticeable dizziness, very small headache, tense muscles in head and neck, tiredness, and mild anxiety. I'm amazed that an OTC supplement could have such a potent psychoactive effect; I was not expecting this at all, much less the opposite of the promised antianxiolytic effects. Everyone reacts differently to therapeutics, but I would seriously urge anyone interested in trying ashwagandha to start much smaller than the recommended dose, especially if you have anxiety disorders or are ""reactive"" by nature. I think it's just bad body chemistry in my case and I will not be taking ashwagandha again.",49,60

Ashwagandha,,25-34,,Other,2019-08-26,5,5,5,5,"I started taking this after I had a nervous breakdown a few years ago. I hadn't slept more than like 15 hours in over a month, my heart wouldn't stop pounding, I was constantly nauseous, and anti-anxiety medication only made me worse. My mom had some thyroid supplements with adaptogens like this in it, and I had read that it helped balance out your cortisol levels (stress hormones), so I took one or two a day. The first night I managed to sleep about 3 hours, the second 6 hours, and by the third night, I had slept through the night. After that episode, I began alternating between an Ashwagandha supplement and a tulsi tea with Gotu Kola (another adaptogen). I did that pretty regularly for a month. Now I only take the Ashwagandha when I feel like I'm spiraling. The supplements I take are 450mg per pill. I only took one or two with a lot of water. Start with the lowest dose; don't immediately jump to a 1000mg pill. Everyone reacts differently to these things. If Ashwagandha doesn't work for you, try one of the other adaptogens. I take this on top of watching my diet (greasy food, alcohol, sugar, etc.), deep breathing, being proactive, and journaling. This supplement probably won't cure your anxiety, but it will keep it from getting out of hand.  *Also don't get it as a tea. It tastes awful.",120,136

However, a year ago I began experiencing issues with peripheral vascular disease associated with varicose veins (ulcerations and subcutaneous bleeding on my calves, joint pain and stiffness, planar fasciitis and chronic leg cramps).     Within weeks of treating my varicose veins with compression stockings and elevation, I noted increased postural tachycardia, which became debilitating after 3 months (could no longer work). While waiting to see my PCP, I came off the melatonin and both my tachycardia and varicose veins began improving significantly. Three weeks after discontinuing its use, the tachycardia disappeared and the varicose veins improved enough to allow me to go without compressions stockings for intervals of several hours.    Have found nothing to explain the correlation but for a study in European Journal of Phramocology, vol 345, 1 March 1998 (NIH medical journal database), where the authors discuss the presence of MT1 & MT2 receptors (to which melatonin binds) in smooth muscle of vascular tissue and their role in vasodilation and constriction, respectively, as an explanation for melatoninâs systemic efficacy.    While my overall condition improved when I discontinued use, I did experience a brief period of cognitive impairment and an uptick in mean blood pressure, the latter of which may require me to seek treatment should it persist. Finally have a follow-up with a cardiologist.  ",86,96

Possibly even ""addictive"" (or cause a dependence); I'm tempted to take the ""good ones"" for afternoon naps!    But the problem is, each brand and dose of melatonin (and possibly each ""batch"") is SO different. A few brands have worked consistently better than prescription sleep aids for me, but unfortunately MOST brands are either ineffective, or produce the opposite effect desired (eg, I needed a Xanax to counteract the nervous, gittery feelings, then I still couldn't sleep but at least I wasn't jittery.)    One 3mg brand I like is pretty consistent for me (and $3/month! cheap!), but the same brand has a few other doses, plus a ""dissolvable"" 3mg dose with sweetening added, and of course all the bottles look the same, so I've accidentally bought the wrong ones (or if the right ones were sold out, tried another dose): ALL the other doses of the ""good brand"" didn't work. And the sugary one gave me the ""nervousness"" effect.    After a few YEARS of trying melatonin for sleep (on and off), though I have a decent one now, I really think the FDA should be looking at what these vitamin companies put into these pills. At least there should be consistency from ""batch to batch"" (same brand/dose).    So when you hit luck with a good one, it's very effective. But it really feels like a crapshoot when you open the next bottle. I'd love to put my brand/dose as 5-star satisfaction, but since this review is just ""melatonin"", I've got to consider the rest of my experiences with melatonin. Mostly positive, but even the few times I've gotten ""the jitters"" ...why package and sell a sleep aid that makes insomnia a nightmare? It makes it tempting to go back to prescription meds (where the FDA at least has a say).",77,85

I've settled on Natrol, because it works. There are probably others that work also, but I haven't seen any reason to experiment unless/until the Natrol becomes unavailable or stops working. Remember that these are not manufactured as drugs and there is no required test for what's in the tablet. If the first brand doesn't work for  you, try others until you find one.

It has negative side effects such as dry mouth and sometimes leaves me tired in the morning. Melatonin seems to have some beneficial side effects such as bolstering my immune system.

They came up with no reason for this happening. I have went to different medical doctors, nuerologists, podiatrists, spine dr. Anyone and everyone... no answers. After researching about medications on the internet I had notice that hydrochlorathiazine shows many side effects, one of them being numbness, and burning in feet and neuropathy.

It used to be that I could not even walk on a floor barefoot without severe pain and I couldn't get to sleep at night because of the burning and stinging in my feet. It seems to be getting better. Could this medication be the cause and if so what can I take as a different medication in place of this. I have been taking it now for 12 years. I am taking it because I have too much calcium in my urine that has caused me to get kidney stones.
