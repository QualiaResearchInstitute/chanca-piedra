Mark W,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2022",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Thank you Chanca Piedra!  This product absolutely worked for me.  A 65 year old male diagnosed with a 6 mm kidney stone entering ureter on left side by CT scan.  First time in my life that I experienced this type of pain.  Couldnâ€™t sit, stand, lay down, nothing would ease the pain.  I was prescribed pain meds by the urologist and told I hade a 50/50 chance of passing the stone.  He told me to make a follow up appointment in 30 days to reassess the situation.My daughter did some on-line research for me and found this product.  We were impressed with the many positive reviews and ratings.  Faced with the proposition of being in pain for at least 30 more days and having to possibly go through other medical procedures to blast it or extract it, I figured what did I have to lose by trying Chanca Piedra.  I took two pills twice a day for eight days before passing the stone with no issue.  The pain meds helped me manage the pain while giving Chanca Piedra time to work.  I also took flowmax as directed by doctor, and 2 capsules of apple cider vinegar daily (I decided to add this on my own) and I drank lots of water.  All of this, coupled with Godâ€™s answer to my prayers, got me out of pain, out of this situation, and back to normal.A couple sandlike particles appeared in the toilet bowl 2 or 3 urinations prior to passing the big one - a 6mm diameter soft dark brown  deflated pea-shaped membrane that shot out while peeing with no pain or issue.  I am now pain and stone free.  I am such a believer in this product that Iâ€™m leaving this review for the next person in similar circumstance and telling anyone and everyone I know about this product",146 people found this helpful,Size: 180 Count (Pack of 1)

J. Shorts,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2020",true,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband has intermittent bouts of Gout, depending on his diet, the weather, and how much water he does or does not drink.  When he has experienced an episode of it, he hurts.  It stinks to see someone I love hurt.I bought this supplement on a whim to see if it helped, and it has.  He states that he definitely feels better when he is taking this.  He can take this routinely, or he can take a medicine prescribed by his health care physician.  He says that this supplement reduces episodes, and that he feels better when he takes it.As to the science, it holds up.  While not approved by the FDA, clinical studies have found that chanca piedra reduces urinary oxalate and uric acid -- this stuff reduces the ability of your pee to create kidney stones.  A 2014 study found that chanca piedra has the ability to inhibit the growth of H. pylori, which, as an organism, is a jerk:  it's connected to cancer and stomach ulcers.  It has been found to help people with hep B by stopping its growth.  The reason that chanca piedra helps fight gout is that gout episodes occur when high levels of uric acid present in the body.  Less uric acid, less gout.My husband took this for a month to see a difference.  Now he asks me to re-order it when he is running low.  I take this as a real sign of its efficacy, because, well, he's a man.  Ha ha.I recommend that anyone with gout symptoms give it a try after reading up on its contraindications and talking to his or her doctor.  We did, and it is now a constant in his medicine cabinet.",32 people found this helpful,Size: 180 Count (Pack of 1)
AK,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2022",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had 2 horribly painful episodes of passing kidney stones a few years ago, and my scan revealed many more forming in my kidneys-eek! I did some research( always prefer natural/herbal supplements to drugs) and started taking 1-2 caps of this a day, and of course trying to drink lots more water.  I didn't have any more incidents, and sometimes it felt like I was passing fine ""sand"" in my urine but nothing painful. I recently had another kidney scan and they are now completely clear! I also used it on my cat, who suffered from chronic bladder stones  and she is fine now too! So now I think I will just take it once a week as maintenance. Kitty gets a pinch of the powder from the capsule every day now in her wet food. No more expensive vet bills! Give it a try",20 people found this helpful,Size: 180 Count (Pack of 1)

I am so happy someone is making this available to everyone and doing it in a responsible way.I read the reviews before buying to be sure I felt confident the herb may work for me.Expect with All natural remedies that they must be followed by strict repetitive regimen long term in order to see results.Disclaimer: I don't think that a particular remedy, even if it has been proven effective, will necessarily work for a particular malady, just because there are certain causes and conditions at work in each individual instance.If you are facing grave pain, like a kidney stone, I say it's worth it to check it out. Always following Dr. advice along with your own thoughts.The capsules are clear, showing powdered dark green contents. And there is no smell or taste I can perceive.I have a sensitive stomach and feel nothing, even when I take 2 capsules together.I have only just begun with this formula, and plan to update when there are results to add to this review.",4 people found this helpful,Size: 180 Count (Pack of 1)

J.P.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2022",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,Have had stones before and tried this product before. For me taking it a few weeks is all I need to pass a stone without any real pain or other issues. Nothing else works as well as this product. If you have stones I would recommend using it and then keeping a bottle on the shelf ""just in case"" you need it. This really works and I would recommend it over any medical procedure that from what I have heard is not all that reliable.,One person found this helpful,Size: 180 Count (Pack of 1)

K Lake,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2023",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The photo is of all the supplements I take (not all at once or even daily). The first few days I took the Chanca Piedra, I noticed my inflammation was practically non existent and it was the only supp I had taken. I donâ€™t recall if my diet helped or hindered, but I did know that I had taken 3 caps for 3 days in a row. That is not the reason why I purchased them, but itâ€™s a major boon. As far as breaking stones, I do not know. I was hoping they would keep them from forming and overall help kidney/ liver functions. If they reduce my inflammation, my guess is they are also performing as marketed. In my experience so far, I am impressed and would suggest you try this if you are on the fence. As of yesterday, I also incorporate Cymbiotikaâ€™s Shilajit, also purchased for inflammation+, so I expect if I should come back to update my review, that it will be of more positive functioning of my kidney/ liver/ immunity.

Lord Pontop,Miracle Capsules!,"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on December 29, 2022",true,,"This year I began suffering from kidney stones.  I was waking up in the night in sheer agony from the most sickening dull, achey pain in my kidneys.  Thew pain was coming in waves and making me incredibly nauseous to the point I was physically sick on one occasion.  On two occasions, I was on the verge of calling an ambulance I was in such pain... and I have a high pain threshold!  I did some research and found these ""Stone Breaker"" capsules on Amazon and I also did my research online.  WOW!  After a few days of taking two capsules a day... I've never had any kidney pain since!!  On the third day of taking them, I did notice my pain shifted from the left-hand side of my lower back area to the front.  I knew then Chanca Piedra were working.  After that... I've not had even a twinge since!  Get these capsules!  It will save you a trip to A+E and relieve you of your pain.",19 people found this helpful,Size: 180 Count (Pack of 1)

First time in my life that I experienced this type of pain. Couldnâ€™t sit, stand, lay down, nothing would ease the pain I was prescribed pain meds by the urologist and told I hade a 50/50 chance of passing the stone.so i did abit of research and with this product and apple cider vinegar the pain went away within 4 days of taking it. I took two pills twice a day with food and I drank lots of Water. Had my ct scan 10 days later and no kidney stone to be seen. I watched videos on YouTube which shows the pain stages i would go through passing the stone and i can genuinely say it isnt called stone breaker for no reason.
