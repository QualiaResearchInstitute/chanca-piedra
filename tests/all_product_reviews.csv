I've been their biggest cheerleader, always directing others with kidney stones to their product. However, when I went to reorder recently, I could not find the 1000 mg tablets they've carried in the past, so I contacted the company directly and was told that they no longer carry or make the 1000 mg tabs, only a 500 mg powder-filled capsule now instead. I ordered the 500 mg, but am very disappointed as they are no match for the tablets, even when doubling the dose.

It switched from my left kidney to my right and after it switched sides, I only produced a single stone the first time then the pain of passing a stone was occurring every few weeks. After a while I would produce bloody urine frequently and I finally got a CT scan to confirm what I feared. a 2cm stone was in my right kidney. The nephrologist said ""your kidney is functioning in normal levels"" so they didn't suggest doing anything about it and I'm seriously dumbfounded, because of the amount of pain I was in. Pain makes us think differently, My next step was to figure out a way to make a DIY lithotripsy machine. Luckily I found the stonebreaker chanca piedra. Within a month I was back to feeling normal and I decided to take a bottle's worth of 1 pill a day as maintenance. I ran out and felt fine so I didn't get a new bottle. 1 year later, I bought another bottle as I passed a small stone.This stuff truly is amazing. It works at least for the uric acid based stones which is what I produced.",11 people found this helpful,

I've altered my diet, take suppliments and drink enough water to fill a swimming pool but nothing seemed to help me as much as Chanca Piedra. I happened to stumble upon an article about it and thought I'd give it a try. After going through a few different, pricier, brands I finally found the Alerna brand. This is straight Chanca Piedra. No mixes, no fillers nothing extra to get in the way or give the manufacturer an excuse to charge a ridiculous made up price for something that doesn't work. I've been taking it now for a few months and have noticed a distinct difference in my kidney stone output as well as the way my body handles dealing with a passing stone. They nickname this stuff the ""stonecrusher"" and from what I've seen the shoe fits. Imagine going to the restroom to urinate and peeing out what appears to be a powdered version of what you normally contend with. For the first time cloudy urine didn't mean I had a UTI. It meant my body was flushing out pulverized kidney stone! If you deal with kidney stones at all I believe this product may be beneficial for you.

After learning about Chanca Piedra, I had to give it a try.I never saw the results that some people saw within a few days or weeks, but I stuck with my daily regimen, which I had decided on: 4 capsules 30 mins after lunch and 4 more 30 mins after dinner (as well cutting out ALL soft drinks, with the occasional one every 6-7 days).  I began on January 24 and at the time of this writing during the first week of March, I have ZERO pains in my stomach near the area of my galbladder.  I do have some slight pain in my right shoulder that began 2-3 weeks prior to this review, but it is starting to subside (which I would guess/attribute to stones moving through duct and some accompanying inflammation) .  More importantly - I am head-over-heels that I feel no stomach pain!!!If you are dealing with galbladder issues, this can't hurt.  Try it for at least 1-3 months if you don't get instant relief.

Very terrifying, please do not buy until FDA looks at this stuff. ugh,from google gemini: Yes, it absolutely makes sense that you experienced dizziness and heart racing after taking chanca piedra while also being on hydrochlorothiazide (thiazides). Here's why:Additive blood pressure effects: Both chanca piedra and hydrochlorothiazide can lower blood pressure. Taking them together can lead to a more significant drop than intended, potentially causing dizziness and lightheadedness.Electrolyte imbalance: Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic that can cause the body to lose electrolytes, particularly potassium. Chanca piedra might further contribute to this imbalance. Electrolyte imbalances can affect heart rhythm and lead to heart palpitations.It's important to stop taking chanca piedra immediately.

It's quite easy and so much better than for you (and cheaper) than taking the prescriptions they want you to take.  The reason I say Tart is Smart is better is because it is a much heavier concentrate than what's out on the market now.

My last lithotripsy was a few months ago in September for a 1.3 centimeter stone. My last xray was clear, but the CT scan showed alot of fragments still in that kidney. I decided to try chanca piedra and started taking it. It was a different brand in pill form. I took it daily from that time for 3 months and it didn't help move out any additional stones. I didnt want more buildup back to a large stone again, so I decided to try this brand in liquid form instead. Ive been taking it once a week for about a month. On Thursday I felt a sharp pain in my right side just for a few minutes. I knew a stone was coming down the ureter. I came home and took a dose of this. This morning, I unknowingly passed 2 small stones. The stones were soft and disintegrated when I touched them with a Q-tip. They did not have the hard sharp edges that my prior ones did. I had no pain at all and didn't even know I had passed them! I can't believe it softened them that much! I know i have more, so I just ordered another bottle. I am going to take it daily instead of weekly. This liquid form works so much better than the pill form in other brands. I am going to continue taking this to try to move it all out and as a preventative after that. People need to have patience, sometimes this doesn't work overnight and sometimes it literally does. Some stones are more stubborn with higher or different mineral compositions and crystal concentration. One thing I promise it does, it 100% softens them and makes them much less painful as they pass from the kidneys to the bladder because the sharp edges are gone!

The pain intensified in just a few short minuets.  I was on my knees in pain about to vomit, face sweating, and could not find relieve in any position.  After 4 hours of this, I started looking through the medicine cabinet for anything that would relieve the pain so I could get some sleep.  As I could only find ibuprofen, I took two, which seemed to help, Saturday mooring I felt great!  I was even able to get a P90X work-out in, before going shopping with my wife.  Halfway through shopping, my symptoms returned.  I couldn't wait to get back home and take something for the pain.  I remember feeling every bump in the road as it shot pain up my back.  Again, several ibuprofens and 45 minutes later the pain was gone!  I went to my family doctor on Monday, based on a urine sample, she said it looks like a kidney stone.  As this was my first, I had no idea what I was dealing with.  An X-Ray and Cat-scan that day confirmed a 7,5mm stone was stuck in my ureter.  As this was said to be too large to pass, she advised me to contact the Urology Group in Cincinnati, and she put me on Flowmax.  Researching this on the internet, I started drinking lots of water with lemon juice and apple cider vinger each day.  Although still no pain, on March 13, the Urology Group performed an Extracorporeal shockwave  Lithotripsy to break up the stone.  Although they said the procedure was successful, breaking the stone into two pieces, a day later only some gravel and a bee-bee size piece were expelled.  Although still no pain, two weeks later a follow-up X-ray revealed the stone was still 6,5mm and still stuck in my ureter.  Therefore, aside from pain of the procedure and a cost of $10,000, the Lithotripsy did very little, and the Urology Group then prescribed a more invasive procedure of using a laser to go inside and break it up.  Not looking forward to another procedure and encouraged by the many successful reviews, I ordered this product.  In addition to the Flowmax and drinking 2.5 liters of water per day with concentrated lemon juice, I have been taking it as prescribed for two weeks now, with no results whatsoever!  I was discouraged to hear that this company recently changed their ingredients and the reviews since then have been far less successful.  Unless the pain returns, I believe I will try to wait this out to see if it will eventually pass.  I will repost as this progresses, and hopefully share with all a success story, but for now, this product doesn't seem to help at all!  For the past week, I doubled down on the dosage, two in the morning two in the evening, still no results!",3 people found this helpful,Size: 60 Count (Pack of 1)

I have had NO other attacks or even ""ripples"" of anything since. A month age I needed a ""cat scan"" for another issue and guess what? The kidney stone was alive and well and living in the bladder wall. It was NOT reduced in size at all. It had not been passed or broken down. I had surgery today, Aug. 16, 2023 toremove it.

Since then, my attacks have gotten worse and worse. They used to last 15 to 30 minutes, and now they prolong for hours. So bad - I can expect to be out of commission for at least two days. But the thing of it is I don't want surgery and was trying to find any natural way to help dissolve my gallstones. By researching, I happen to come across Stonebreaker by Chanca Piedra. I read all the positive comments on this thread and decided why not. I gave it a go.I've taken these pills for the last 3 days. Morning and night with water and with my meal. No symptoms. I was thankful for that cause I was scared lol. On the fourth day, I had a late lunch - my first meal of the day. I ate lunch and took my pill. (I had a salad). About two hours later, I’m not even sure what the heck went wrong but my back and right side were KILLING me. I almost mistook it for a gallbladder attack, but eventually noticed the pain was something else - Not my usual gallbladder area under my breast, but my right kidney area (wrapping around my back and side). The pain was so heavy, it stopped me in my tracks and my husband helped me to the bed.My husband helped me by applying a heating pad to my kidney area. Within an hour the intense pain subsided. But the dull ache was still there. That was Saturday. I'm typing this Tuesday night and I can't bend over, twist and turn certain ways without that same dull intense pull/ache. And this happened on the 4th day of taking these pills. Sitting for long periods of time HURTS. Anything that applies pressure to my right kidney side HURTS. The only way I don't feel uncomfortable is if I stand.  I have never ever had a problem with my kidneys. Never. But now it seems I do. I'm praying the pain will just go away, but I will be visiting a Doctor Thursday if it doesn't.I honestly thought I was going to feel something in my gallbladder since there are stones there and not in my kidney, but that was NOT the case. At least for me, it wasn't. I discontinued use of these pills and will be doing more heavy research on them. I encourage you to do the same. I see that this is a good product for some people, and I'm glad they were able to help the majority. I’m not sure what went wrong with me. Maybe not enough water? Not enough rest? I am a very healthy girl except for my stones. I exercise and love eating healthy (especially since 2019). So, I don't know. I just felt like I should share my story because I know what it's like to have gallstones and have no hope of curing them with doctors always ready to cut on you. You are desperate for a solution and ready to try anything – I know I was. I will try to update my condition soon. But in the meantime, if you consider this product, just make sure you do HEAVY research on it.

To start, I got word of this product from a youtube video, someone said that it worked very well also the reviews were outstanding.  However,my experience was very different. About 2 months ago I had my first gallbladder attack ,extremely painful and scary. I eat a very healthy whole foods diet prior, so taking this I figured would only aid in getting rid of any further attack or previous stones from not eating the best when I was younger. I bought my first bottle. Followed the instructions and for about 2 weeks, there was no pain, no sign of gallbladder attacks, I was convinced that this was the reason. I was so excited that I bought another bottle to have on hand before my first ran out. After 2 weeks of taking it,I was doubled over in severe pain. Worst pain of my life and nothing would take it away. After 2 days of chronic pain I was rushed to the ER where they told me I had a lodged stone, and pancreatitis due to the lodged stone. Worst pain you will ever feel! Also i was told that i would need my gallbladder removed immediately.  When removing my gallbladder a duct was clogged with what was described as sludge and mini stones. Now this could be a coincidence or this product was breaking up stuff and got it stuck in my duct causing all these issues. It is no joke when I say, take these with a risk.

He has not passed the stone yet. However, he is able to get through the day without puking or ending up on the ground in tears since he began taking the product. Keep in mind that the amount of help that this product has given him is unknown because he had started the process of water and lemon juice 5 days prior to the product. Those two things are what they recommend to help with passing a stone, but there is a clear difference since starting the product.

Many tests later, the scan came back showing that my stone is still in my track and it will need to be removed with surgery. I found Stone Breaker and ordered it immediately. The package came a day late so I am trying to play catch up in taking the pills in hopes of passing the stone before my scheduled surgery 1/17/22. I have taken 6 pills total over the last 2 days and have not passed any stone yet but I will say this is the first time in weeks I haven't had to take any pain medication. These herbs have definitely taken away my pain and have helped tremendously in helping me urinate. For weeks I've been sitting in warm baths for hours but since taking the herbs I haven't taken a single bath and have slept through the night. I was told that one week before surgery I would need to stop taking any vitamins or herbal supplements before surgery which would mean I have to stop today. I am so determined to pass this without surgery I am going to take these for 1 more day in hopes I get lucky and can cancel surgery. I read a review here online of an x-ray technician stating if the stone is obstructing your tract then these will not help. Unfortunately mine is obstructing my tract so If i don't pass it before my surgery, I'll know why. Either way I plan to continue taking this medicine after surgery as a preventative.

I initially took 2 capsules per day as directed, but after one month, tapered down to 1 capsule a day as I wasn't having UTI-like symptoms anymore and it was more in hopes of preventing more stones/existing stones from growing. The symptoms I did have (frequent nocturia, UTI-like symptoms of burning and pain) resolved after less than a week of taking two capsules per day.September 2021, had another CT scan to find the 1.5mm stone vanished (I wasn't aware of passing anything, and I understand it can be excruciating) and the 2.5mm stone is now 3mm but the Hounsfield density decreased from 400-something to 300-something.Other habits I picked up included:1. Drinking the juice of two fresh lemons every day2. Avoiding all high oxalate foods (former keto dieter, unfortunately)3. Ensuring I get enough dairy when I do eat moderately-high oxalate foods4. Drinking 5+ liters of water a day depending on my activity level.I'm certainly not going to stop taking this supplement if there's even a 1% percent chance it helped get rid of the other stone and saved me the suffering of passing it.

I don’t think it actually breaks the stone( maybe others have had different experiences) but it seems to relax the ureter. The doctors can prescribe Flo max, which I was taking. This chance piedra has a similar effect with this brand in particular doing the best job in replicating the effect of the prescription drug. I would get this dull back pain and the doctor proscribed me flow max for a stricture I had dialiated but was still having symptoms. It helped, but it had a weird side effect of retrograde ejactulation and was not as pleasurable without the medicine. This one, has no side effects, just works. I’ve been using it on and off when I have pain with good results. It really seems like a natural way to relax things, but don’t buy it expecting a miracle that your stone will break. Stones are hard and the only thing you can do is take lemons to maybe erode some of the stone and this stone breaker to relax things and help it come out.",4 people found this helpful,Size: 60 Count (Pack of 1)

Th family doctor said it was 'muscular-skeletal' but I talked him into giving me an MRI.  This showed the Kidney stones - two of them, slightly smaller than a pair of dice.He did not have any easy solutions for me - surgery would be very expensive.  So I went to a naturalist who recommended Magnesium tablets, which I took for about two weeks.  I did not sense any results, so I started hunting for something else on the web, and found these on Amazon.  Along with the Magnesium tablets, I started taking these tablets (or maybe they were capsules - I do not remember) twice a day.  This worked.  After about a week of taking these twice a day with about 8 oz of water, the stone passed, relatively painlessly.  The only problem was the the pills seemed to cause bouts with sudden, unexpected, and almost uncontrollable diarrhea. This started the third day, I think.This was still vastly preferable to other ways of dealing with the stones, and the pills may not have this effect on you.  I have no way of knowing.  But you might want to be cautious with your plans the first couple of days that you take these pills.",23 people found this helpful,Size: 60 Count (Pack of 1)

The doctor came back in the room and said he was going to prep me for surgery again I was pumped up with morphine no pain thought I would just go home and investigate further as far as homeopathic cures then I stumbled across this chanca Piedra which as I understand translates to stonebraker figured for $30 what did I have to lose. So I took two a day for about 4 weeks had no flare-ups stop taking them for a while had a flare up Fourth of July 2018 at a barbecue on my way home became nauseous threw up when I got to my driveway got in the house took two capsules lay down and literally within 15 minutes felt completely fine I have  had a few other flare-ups in the meantime and I always carry a few of these with me every single time I have had one I popped two of these and pain is gone don't know why the doctors don't recommend this before surgery but I feel like it's a miracle cure.Update: Okay so I had another gallstone attack yesterday (9-27-18) at 4 am I woke up with a slight pain and got up immediately and took two caps. NOTHING! Pain increased to the point after 4 hours I was taken to the emergency room again to get Morphine. I probably shouldn't have eaten the three greasy tacos late the night before. I am going to get back to taking one every day to see what happens and stay away from the grease as much as possible. I will update in a few months to see how it goes.

But I wasn’t in real pain, just moderately uncomfortable (although sustained discomfort takes a toll, too). I ended up having to have my gallbladder removed but I am pretty sure it was Stonebreaker that kept me from the excruciating pain I should have, by all rights, been in. I gave it 4 stars only because this is obviously anecdotal and it may not have been the reason for my lack of pain.

I hope my review will bring you hope if you are struggling with kidney stones.It started in the summer of 2022 when I was 4 months pregnant. At the time, it was UTI like symptoms. Due to my pregnancy, I was unable to take any type of herbal supplements I was just given pain medication. I dealt with the intolerable pain for two months and when I was 6 months pregnant I had emergency removal of 2 stones one on each side- 0.5mm and 0.8mm following stent placement for a week and stent removal and yes- that felt like I was giving birth. MRI performed before the removal of the stones showed I had 2 smaller stones on each kidney which were not removed during the procedure.Fast forward a year later- July 2023 I started with UTI like symptoms once again. I knew right away they were the kidney stones. I went to my urologist to test for a UTI and she confirmed there was indeed blood in urine confirming stones. I decided to try this product as it was my only and last hope as I was preparing myself for yet another removal procedure and financial strain on my savings. Ordered on Sunday night, product arrived on Tuesday and took as followed:1. Tuesday night- I had excruciating pain (pain level 9). It got worse when I took a glass with lime. Flank pain started and I took two supplements. Thirty minutes later I had very little to no urine and my bladder was hurting. I was debating whether to go to the ER. About 45 min into the pain I felt sharp pinching as the stone was moving down my urethra. Immediately after the sharp pinching feeling I was able to urinate.  Pain diminished slowly and was able to rest for the night.2. Wednesday morning- While fasting as soon as I woke up I took another glass with lime and added apple cider vinegar. I took one supplement with it. I was feeling ok throughout the morning with mild UTI like burning symptoms. By the afternoon after having some lunch, I had another glass with lime and apple cider vinegar. My pain increased to sharp pinching feeling in my urethra and pressure. I knew the stone was there and was a matter of time before I urinated it out. About an hour into my pain when laying down the sharp feeling intensified and all of a sudden it was gone- instant relief?! I ran to the restroom I heard a clank on the toilet bowl and there it was the stone!I will continue to take this to hopefully dissolve the others out. I highly recommend this product along with taking it with lime water and apple cider vinegar. I hope to never look back on kidney stone surgery removal and I hope you never have to go through that.

I am a alliterative health practitioner applied kinesiology 22 years experience. Stones form in the liver and make there way to the gallbladder and they will only show up on a ultrasound or X-ray if they are calcified. Stones can be big or small and feel like a lump of clay. They are green tan or white. Depending on how old  they are white are the newest formed tan then green are older. Green is the colour of liver bile and what gives your poop the brown colours. You can also have chaff which is a gritty sludge and looks like bits of rice. Stress Fungus parasites built up in the body can clog the pipes. The liver is your filter of cholesterol old hormones old blood cells etc etc so when its clogged up you will be tired, cranky,  weird hungry pains. Hormonal imbalances, migraines headaches and intolerance for greasy fatty foods and alcohol. And raise your cholesterol in the body as it is not being filtered out properly.This supplement is a godsend to people chronically ill with digestive upsets and much more.  It cleans the gunk out.

Thanks! Lol! Whatever! I’m in pain. I don’t care.I took this tea, 2 bags steeped for 5 minutes in one cup about 25 minutes ago!At emergency I was told I have one 6mm stone that just left the kidney.Yesterday, I got another x-ray to see if it moved, but my doctor apparently is too busy to read it and tell me the results for 3 days. Maybe more. Too busy I guess.The x-ray tech and I clearly see 2 stones. One in kidney and one in the bladder? Did it break? Did they not see one in the CT scan. The urologist hasn’t told me, because he apparently is too busy.My bladder is totally reacting to this! I never heard so many noises in my bladder.I’m scared, but I don’t trust the Dr. and he has never even had a stone. He couldn’t care less. I trust the actual results of people who have taken this more than I trust him. I trust these reviews more than I trust him, because he doesn’t care.I was in emergency 8 days ago in the most excruciating pain of my life. They helped me and gave me the medications listed. I hope it’s okay to take this tea with those medications. I’m also taking:Flomax/TamsulosinNaproxen 500 mgHydrocodone-AcetaminI 100% feel my kidney is now making noises since I drank this tea!

I felt more myself last night than I have in the past week, and I finally felt hope that I would be ok. About 24 hours later, I painlessly peed this stone out.

Now that had to come out. We are 3 days in and i kept drinking the tea (3 times a day). But the sludge was only coming out slowly. Finally 7 days later my gallbladder is empty and back to normal. Avoided a trip to the ER and surgery. Thanks.Edit: what I went through is not for everybody. It was a battle at home. I did everything while on a liquid diet no sugars or solids as well as nothing greasy. It has been years and still no pain and no stones and I eat healthy but back to normal. Thanks.",130 people found this helpful,Size: 25 Count (Pack of 1)

Drink the tea after steeping for 5 min. Have a pain pill on hand. A real pain pill not Excedrine etc.  In 20 min or so you will feel an uncomfortable feeling that will get even worse. When you can’t stand the pain take the pain pill and drink lots of water. When you have to “go” push hard and both times I did this my stream went from not much to a normal stream. Keep drinking water to see if you can pass anymore. Stop if your pain pill stops working but remember to push. Without a pain pill it would be terribly painful though.,14 people found this helpful,Size: 25 Count (Pack of 1)

I knew something was going on the last week with my urine it’s been dark and also been having nausea and testicle pains. I have a history of kidney stones but I didn’t connect the two because I always had severe pains in my flank the past times I’ve had stones. I have also been taking a low dose of chemo which messes with your liver so I was scared the medicine was affecting my liver even tho I had gotten my liver test the previous week. ( I’m a worry wart) I made a urologist appt and a gp appointment both are 2 weeks awa!! So I wanted to clean my liver and kidneys so I stumbled upon this tea while browsing. Based on the reviews which I’m always skeptical  about I bought the tea.  Received my order today. I got home from work at 5 drank the tea with alittle honey at 7:30. It just taste like unsweetened tea like green Tea not bad, not good but relaxing. Anyway, it’s now 10:30 I urinated 10 min ago, I felt stinging in my penis and when I tel you there was about 6-7 small stones in the bottom of the cup I know I have more in me because I still have penis pain I can actually feel them wanting to come out so I’m drinking crazy water right now anyway, the point to all of you was I was utterly amazed on how effective and fast this actually works. This is making me want to explore other herbal medicinal plants. This is an honest review it’s a miracle tea. I’m drinking this every Morning for the rest of my life.

A year ago it was 5 mm. Then he told me that it had grown in size and that I would now need surgery. I absolutely did not wanna do surgery but the size of the stone was too big to pass so I thought I would give this product a try. I had only taken  One full bottle which I think lasted me A little over a month. I only took it one to two times a day if I could remember. I was also taking fulvic acid as a friend recommended that to me saying that that dissolved her kidney stone. Honestly I was so scared to take this because I thought if it broke it up in pieces then I would have several stones I would have to pass and I didn’t wanna go through that pain either so I was beyond scared but I thought I’ll do it anyway. Today I went to the hospital for a different reason but they did a kidney scan my 10 mm stone is now only 2 mm. I am blown away I can’t believe it I am so excited and happy . I am going to get another bottle and keep taking it. I’m not sure if it was a combination of both things I was taking or this alone. But literally I only took it for less than two months and that’s how small my stone Got I did not pass any stones or feel any pain.

I was diagnosed with 4-5 mm kidney stone stuck in my ureter. This is my first time ever  having a kidney stone. My doctor told me it was likely not going to pass because of the size & location but prescribed some medicine & said we could wait it out for a couple of weeks. I prefer natural remedies so decided not to take the prescription. A few days later I had a kidney stone attack & was in so much pain, inflamed, flank pain, running to the toilet literally every 10 min for nothing but dribbles, slight nausea, & I could barely walk so stayed in bed all day. Long story short I made an anti-inflammatory juice shot (ginger root, apple, orange, lemon, tumeric powder, & black pepper). About 30 min later I started feeling better!! The pain, inflammation, & nausea subsided! I wad able to move around & cook dinner. I decided to try the chanca piedra to help in passing the stone. After 3 days of the juice shot 2x/day & the chanca piedra 3x/day my urinary retention cleared! I was no longer dribbling. I was determined to pass the stone naturally so I pushed my follow up appt out to 2 months & for those 2 months this was my daily remedy : 1.) drank 12-16 cups of water daily starting the morning off with 2 cups of warm lemon or lime water, 2.) chanca piedra 3x/ day, & 3.) a cup of ACV water (2 Tbsp unfiltered organic  apple cider vinegar) 5x/day (*1 week on & 1 week off*). I also prayed to God that my stone would not only pass naturally but that it would dissolve so I wouldn’t feel it…and 2 months later I am excited to say my scan results came back clear!! The doctor was SO suprised that it passed! And I never felt any pain when it passed nor did I ever see it (and I checked every time).

I gave this a 5-star review because it breaks down that substance in my system and keeps me out of the hospital. Plain and simple. Also, It may sound off color but you need to monitor your urine clarity like the doctors do. That way you can tell it's working by being able to read normal size book print through your urine in an average glass jar when it previously may have been cloudy. This way you can figure out your dosage also. Use it as the manufacturer has instructed and you will get immediate results and notice it 4 hours later. We get UTIs and backups, infections and kidney problems if you don't keep the aperture of the urine system dilated by keeping it clean with products like this. High protein based diets require this usually if your body makes stones from proteins easily like mine. I learned the hard way. It Took me years of pain and suffering emotionally and financially as well while figuring this out.

I also found that I could buy it from the closest Natur-thyme grocery store in Dewitt, NY.  The first time I bought and used a small bottle of it was a month before I was scheduled for a KUB, sonogram and my next urologist appointment.  Mind you, I've had high blood pressure since 1980, and been under doctors' care with a urologist, plus a nephrologist ( 5 years).  I also had lithotripsy twice, which broke up the largest stones somewhat, but that's about all it did.  I've maintained a low oxalate diet, plus 64+ oz. of water with lemon juice, especially since retiring in in 2006.  Nothing was stopping the slow growth of kidney stones or the gradual rise of blood pressure.  Finally, after using this as directed for a month, the tests showed the stones were decreasing.  I never felt anything pass, although for the first time ever I had seen 'gravel' after urinating.  So I've continued taking it sporadically for 3 years.  Since January, Natur-Thyme has been back ordered on this product for several months.  I found it on-line, and am trying to stick to a 15 weeks regime.  I know it works, although I haven't told my urologist.",20 people found this helpful,Size: 4 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)

When I shared with a co-worker that I was in the midst of passing another stone .. he told me about these Chanca Piedra drops.. Luckily Vitamin Shoppe had them in stock ( alot more expensive) and I began treating myself immediately. One droplet in a bottle of water every hour on the hour. 5 hours later I passed the larger of the stones around 5+ in size. Being that I have always gotten them what surprised me was how round and smooth it was compared to others.So I have remained on this stuff and passed another two plus several small ones. As someone has has even gotten surgery for kidney stones .. I can tell you THIS STUFF WORKS! I now but the 4 ounce bottle here cause it's super cheap!

It wouldn't pass on its own and the pain was unbearable so I underwent outpatient surgery to remove it, ending up with a stent for a week afterwards - very uncomfortable. When my doctor found 2 kidney stones in my other kidney 8 months later I started researching alternate treatments, and found Chanca Piedra. Given all the glowing reviews, I bought some. My Doctor had me scheduled for outpatient sonic wave procedure to break up my stones so they could pass on their own. I took Chanca tablets 3 times per day for the two weeks prior to the outpatient procedure, and I was sure based on the reviews that they would work. They didn't. They had zero affect on my stones. While in for the sonic procedure, I looked at the live X-ray before going under and saw two, whole, hard as rock stones in my kidney. Chanca did nothing. I wasn't expecting the stones to be gone, but I was expecting to see some evidence of breakup. Nothing. Waste of time and money.

And so I will have to find something else and continue drinking water to flush it out.  I will put some lemon juice in my water as I hear that may help.It looks like some people can tolerate chanca piedra  and not have gastric upsets but others like myself are sensitive to it.I would caution anyone trying this for the first time to stay close to home and a bathroom  just in case it effects you in the same way as it did me.You certainly do not want to be at work or out on a date or out driving or out  shopping and you get hit with stomach cramps and in urgent need of a bathroom.

Stone Free works a bit better for pain but it has licorice root in it and it gave me chest pain separate from the gallbladder pain sometimes. Licorice root can cause kidney or heart failure so watch for signs of pain, in anything you try really. I did not want to be on Lidan Paishi Pian or Jin qian cao for longer than a bottle, as those have arsenic and lead in them but they're also known to help dissolve stones. Those pills did nothing for mine there either, a lot of good painkillers though.I heard Rowachol and TUDCA work better for gallstones specifically. Google dosages and you'll find them. I'm 104kg and at 10mg/kg that would be 1,040 mg in a day for TUDCA. Split 3 ways  is 346mg per meal. 500mg was too much for me and I got pain. Start small on the 250mg bottle for TUDCA. Good luck to whoever is reading this.**UPDATE April 7, 2023: Definitely do Rowachol and TUDCA. I no longer have a stone stuck in the neck of my gallbladder! I ate a flexitarian diet and used Dandy Blend coffee powder to replace coffee for a while. Switched to almond milk. If you have serious inflammation after a gallbladder attack I highly suggest laying off the meat for at least a month or 2. Just my experience, I'm not a doctor.",84 people found this helpful,

Fast forward to first week of april, i started to feel mild back pain and i knew it was the stone moving (but this has been ongoing since feb 2020). So i decided to try this brand of chanca piedra. I received it on apr 14... Took 2 a day for about 5 days.. Then i stopped.. No reason why just forgot to keep taking it. And today is apr 24 and i passed the dark stone (see pic).. Now the only way for me to know for sure if it is the 5mm or 6mm stone is to have an ultrasound or ct or mri.. But I'm willing to bet that it is indeed the 6mm that was in my right side.  For me, i believe these pills helped as i have been trying everything the urologist prescribed for over a year now with no results until this.  I know that stones over 7mm require surgical intervention so I'm glad i didnt have to have it surgically removed (and I've had to have surgery for stone removal as well).",57 people found this helpful,

I heard clinkers hit the bowl. My back has not felt this good for before I hurt my back. Thank you doctors for not thinking this could be an issue. Felt some pain in my right side again the other day took two a the pain subsided. It worked for me and I hope it works for you. Update- I would guess I have used half the bottle 1 at a time when my urine stream gets weak. Anyway been noticing weak stream and felt that twinge in my back and I’m like oh no. So anyway I was bending and doing heavy trailer lifting. Like real heavy and then pain came back and think I pulled muscles in my back… so here is the test I took 2 pills in literally in 1 hour- I got gas and my back pain is almost gone where I can walk again. Wish I owned stock in this company.Ok now we got some serious kidney stone passing. So got the back pain within an hour I was in my bed lying on the side of the pain… it’s what I read you should do. I took two. 1/2 hr pain went I’m like cool. Another half hour my groan hurt like someone was squeezing my -you know- I’m like I gotta go to hospital. I start driving and bam. My junk felt like it was on fire and had to go bathroom. I turned around made to bathroom and excreted the bloodiest brownish mixture I ever seen. Seriously scary… pain went away in 1/2 hr I was back on the job. Two days later for the pain again. Took two. Got a strainer 1/2 hr later caught a 4mm.

I’ve had two surgeries in the past on stones and did not want to go through that again.  My first symptom was the flank pain in my back and I knew it was happening again. Ugh.  I waited quite awhile for it to come down in my ureter and then the pain started. Renal colic is the worst!  I landed in the emergency room and was happy to hear it was a 3.5mm stone with two smaller stones still in my left kidney.  I read the reviews on Amazon and have heard of this natural method actually helping people.  So I took the Chanca Pietdra according to bottle instructions and within 7 days, I passed my stone without any drama what’s so ever!  At first, I was feeling tiny particles when i urinated and I didn’t think anything of it.  What actually happens is the Chanca Piedra breaks it down into small sandy particles making it smaller to pass.  I figured that out when i started to strain my urine and one morning PLOP! Out it came!!!  I did it without surgery!!!  Also, a few tablespoons of vinegar water ,and honey helped along with drinking fresh lemon water sped it along.  I still had to take something for the pain when it was in the ureter, but this product helped to make having a kidney stone manageable.  I believe i get kidney stones from taking antihistamines for my allergies s and NOT drinking enough water.  I ordered the Chanca Piedra tea to drink once a day to ward off the evil stones.  Plus, I’m mindful of drinking my tons of water a day with a little fresh lemon juice.  It may take a little time, or not!!!",55 people found this helpful,

As far as breaking stones, I do not know. I was hoping they would keep them from forming and overall help kidney/ liver functions. If they reduce my inflammation, my guess is they are also performing as marketed. In my experience so far, I am impressed and would suggest you try this if you are on the fence.

This product absolutely worked for me.  A 65 year old male diagnosed with a 6 mm kidney stone entering ureter on left side by CT scan.  First time in my life that I experienced this type of pain.  Couldn’t sit, stand, lay down, nothing would ease the pain.  I was prescribed pain meds by the urologist and told I hade a 50/50 chance of passing the stone.  He told me to make a follow up appointment in 30 days to reassess the situation.My daughter did some on-line research for me and found this product.  We were impressed with the many positive reviews and ratings.  Faced with the proposition of being in pain for at least 30 more days and having to possibly go through other medical procedures to blast it or extract it, I figured what did I have to lose by trying Chanca Piedra.  I took two pills twice a day for eight days before passing the stone with no issue.  The pain meds helped me manage the pain while giving Chanca Piedra time to work.  I also took flowmax as directed by doctor, and 2 capsules of apple cider vinegar daily (I decided to add this on my own) and I drank lots of water.  All of this, coupled with God’s answer to my prayers, got me out of pain, out of this situation, and back to normal.A couple sandlike particles appeared in the toilet bowl 2 or 3 urinations prior to passing the big one - a 6mm diameter soft dark brown  deflated pea-shaped membrane that shot out while peeing with no pain or issue.  I am now pain and stone free.

When he has experienced an episode of it, he hurts.  It stinks to see someone I love hurt.I bought this supplement on a whim to see if it helped, and it has.  He states that he definitely feels better when he is taking this.  He can take this routinely, or he can take a medicine prescribed by his health care physician.  He says that this supplement reduces episodes, and that he feels better when he takes it.As to the science, it holds up.  While not approved by the FDA, clinical studies have found that chanca piedra reduces urinary oxalate and uric acid -- this stuff reduces the ability of your pee to create kidney stones.  A 2014 study found that chanca piedra has the ability to inhibit the growth of H. pylori, which, as an organism, is a jerk:  it's connected to cancer and stomach ulcers.  It has been found to help people with hep B by stopping its growth.  The reason that chanca piedra helps fight gout is that gout episodes occur when high levels of uric acid present in the body.  Less uric acid, less gout.My husband took this for a month to see a difference.  Now he asks me to re-order it when he is running low.  I take this as a real sign of its efficacy, because, well, he's a man.

Potassium citrate,BulkSupplements.com Potassium Citrate Powder,Barney,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2017",true,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered it as a supplemental source of potassium. I did not want pills, as they always contain excipient ingredients. Unlike lite salt (which also contains potassium) this is a bulk product that contains no sodium. Great!Also, its citrate has two side side benefits:1) Citrate intake helps to prevent the most common type of kidney stone.2) Citrates inhibit an enzyme that supports one stage of glycolysis, making them useful in reduction of high blood sugar levels.My visual inspection of the powder I received showed no clumping. That testifies to the thorough sealing and air tightness of its packaging, because potassium citrate is very hygroscopic. I looked for obvious contamination, but saw no foreign matter in it. And it dissolved readily in filtered tap water.Potassium citrate formula : C6H5K3O7So there are 3 atoms of K per molecule of potassium citrate.Thus, potassium citrate is comprised of (3×39) / 306 = 38% potassium (K)With my AWS model AC-100 100 gram digital scale I measured a ¼ US cup volume of Bulk Supplements Potassium Citrate granules to be 63 grams. Since ¼ US cup = 12 US tsp, and the USA adult DV of K is 4700 mg, we have for this supplement :½ tsp = 2625 mg C6H5K3O7; 998 mg K; 21% DV1 tsp = 5250 mg C6H5K3O7; 1995 mg K; 42% DV2 tsp = 10,500 mg C6H5K3O7; 3990 mg K; 85% DV3 ¼ tsp = 17,053 mg C6H5K3O7; 6480 mg K; 138% DVSo the 275 mg serving ( which is only 0.05 tsp ) labeled on this powder's Supplement Facts is insignificantly small. That dose provides only 2% USA adult DV, which is incorrectly labeled as a 3% DV for K. The next richest supplementary source of K ( to this citrate powder ) is Morton Lite Salt, but 2 US tsp of it would be required daily in order to get 80% DV of K, and that would mean an intake of 96% of the sodium DV.TIPSIn general, American adults are recommended to get at least 4,700 mg (100% DV) of potassium daily, while limiting daily sodium to 1,500 mg.  But most Americans are not meeting either goal. See the two USDA reports: 'Potassium Intake of the U.S. Population' and 'Sodium Intake of the U.S. Population'. Perhaps the U.S. National Library of Medicine has set the potassium DV absurdly high? The Austrailian Ministry of Health has set their adult men's DV at 81% as high as the USA's, and their adult women's DV is only 60% as high as the USA's.The richest dietary source of potassium (K) is not a banana, but chard. However, it is extremely high in oxalate. A baked potato (with skin), is richer in K than a banana, but one would have to consume five of them per day in order to obtain 100% of the USA adult DV of K !Extended release potassium citrate tablets are prescribed as a long term therapy for treating calcium oxalate kidney stones. The daily intake of those tablets totals 6400 mg as four equally spaced doses.

The attack only lasted a week and I haven't had one since, but I do not ever want to experience one again.  Now this is internet science, so take it for what it's worth, but I've read that potassium citrate helps dissolve both uric acid and calcium oxalate so that it is excreted through the urine as opposed to ending up in your bloodstream and settling in your joints and/or forming accretions in your bladder/ureter/kidneys.  I haven't conferred with any physicians to get their two cents on the issue, but I'm hoping that by adding a small amount of this product to my diet, I won't need to see any doctors to treat or diagnose either ailment in the first place.

I think it is maybe a combo of the two or the rowatinex making the bigger difference of the two. I was taking lasik and the dr changed to indapamide instead to help not get kidney stones.When starting I had 5 stones in each kidney  biggest being 9mm. After a year taking 3 rowatinex twice a day and the indapamide, I went for exam and I had none in left kidney and several in right all 5mm or less. I have had totally different readings within a week of each other so it is alway hard to trust the competence of technicians. The 2nd year I went in and only had some tiny tiny stones. I decreased my rowitinex to 2 twice a day because it seemed alot I was taking and it is expensive. 3rd year, I was hoping for no sign of stones but there were several in right and one is 6mm. Did decrease in what I was taking in rowatinex make that difference? Not sure on that.My conclusion is that it must be helping, but it is not an instant acting fix for while you are passing a stone. Over the last 3 years I have had kidney stone pain and I chug water while constantly walking and pacing. The stone usually passed or subsided within an hour of doing this. Before starting  on rowatinex, I was having to have lithotripsy every 6 months to a year.I could stop taking it and only take the indapamide to test this but I don't want to risk getting enormous stones i can't pass to test this theory. Right now I will continue with regimen.I heard about rowatinex because a friend was in Germany and passed a stone and the hospital gave her the rowatinex to prevent stones.

Two weeks later I'm still in pain, burning etc. and generally thinking I have an std. Ugh.Well, let's get it over with then right? Headed to the hospital and had the embarrassment of telling them the dreaded statement...""it burns when I pee"".Yea, good times.They make me wait an hour or so and then send me to the lab. They take the blood work and send me over to the Urologist. Of course by now I'm dreading the results and then the doc looks up from the paperwork and says everything looks pretty good. I'm like huh?He said in Spanish I have stones. Ahhhhh phew! Relief it was. The ultrasound showed 3 stones and he said maybe head over to get an MRI to check the rest. At least my kidneys looked good, but that didn't stop the pain.The doc sends me out the door with a script for Ketorolac and Rowatinex. I had never heard of either before now.I picked up the pastillas and headed home. Not even 24 hours later I felt relief. Maybe a fluke right?Took the Ketorolac for only 5 days(apparently it's no bueno after that) and the Rowatinex for 2 weeks.I can't tell if one passed or not, but I felt Great!!!Fast forward to a few months later and I started to get that redness and burning again. Went to the Farmacia and knew to grab the Rowatinex and no script was needed. One day later I felt relief again and have been taking 3-4 a day ever since.

I had a 7x6x4mm stone stuck at the very bottom of my ureter.  I live in the middle of nowhere in the mountains of Guatemala, and the quality of medical care here is iffy at best.  It took them three months to even figure out what was wrong with me, but finally they got a good, clear scan and someone who could read it.  The doctor told me that since the ureter narrows at the junction with the bladder, it was highly unlikely I would ever pass this stone and was doing damage to my kidney by leaving it there.  He wanted to do a ureteroscopy, remove the stone, and put in a stent.  I'd heard awful things about those stents and wasn't too thrilled to get such an invasive procedure done down here in the boonies, so I put him off for weeks.  I heard about Rowatinex from a pharmacist here and decided to stop taking the Flomax (made me dizzy) and try this instead.  I took 2 pills Sunday night, 2 pills 3x on Monday, and passed the stone this morning before I even had a chance to take the pills.  Best part is that I passed it with zero pain!

Rowatinex,Rowatinex by Rowa,C.A.H.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2014",true,4.0 out of 5 stars,"My mother has a small dog who has suffered with bladder stones her whole life. Since I'm the family vet tech, I took the little girl everywhere for assessment and suggestions. Diet, medicine, water changes...nothing worked very well and the stones would periodically recur. Also, often when we tested the urine we would get results of crystals in it. At some point, my mom went on an extended trip to Europe to visit relatives and saw a German vet there just for a checkup. The lady suggested this product. Since then, the little dog has had significantly decreased recurrence of crystals in her urine. Important: this product hasn't removed the urinary troubles completely, but it has worked in addition to all the other things we do for her (diet, low Ph water, occasional treatment) to keep the stones from actually forming. It DOES appear to be a useful supplement, but like anything else, I do not believe it is a miracle cure, and I do not know if drinking cranberry daily would have the same effect. However, you try to get a dog to drink cranberry juice (or me, for that matter)! This thing has worked as well as expected, and a bit better. Now, in all fairness, it works for a dog. I have to imagine it works for humans in the same fashion, when combined with sensible diet, but that's MY OWN assessment.",2 people found this helpful,

Started drinking more fluid, including lemonade juice + olive oil and apple cider vinegar with water, and taking Flomax. Ordered Rowatinex 10 days after stone was found, 2 pills x 3 daily. Passed the stone 26 days after stone was found, or 17 days after taking Rowatinex.The stone caught was the same size as the original size detected by CT scan. So Rowatinex apparently did not dissolve the stone. Did it help with passing my stone? I am not 100% sure. A lot of people with painful kidney stones started to drink a lot of fluid while on Rowatinex. Thus, it is difficult to attribute the successful passing of the stone entirely to Rowatinex, at the least.Maybe, Rowatinex is helpful more on prevention, rather than on treating already-formed kidney stones.

Rowatinex,Rowatinex by Rowa,rose,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2013",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband went to the doctor after what seemed like a kidney stone attack. The doctor said he had a kidney infection and some blood in his urine. He took antibiotics for 10 days, but still we saw blood in his urine. On the tenth day he had another more minor attack of pain. During this time, since I've always believed in natural cures, I started looking on Amazon for products to get rid of stones.I found 'stone blasters' with good reviews, but reviewers often said the pain of passing the stones would still be there regardless. Then I saw the Rowatinex reviews and noticed instead reviewers saying stones passed without pain, that they either became very soft or broke apart. I looked into the product some more online and only found good reviews, no bad ones, with no side effects, so this is the one I ordered. Since people used it for eliminating stones but also for prevention of stones, I'll be taking them as well, and also keep some on hand.After a day of taking the Rowatinex my husband was no longer passing blood, he's just finishing his first bottle (2 bottles in the box). I read online he should take them for a month, he's been on 2 three times a day. He hasn't had any more pain, blood, or problems since starting them.Amazon products always come quickly, within a few days, so while waiting I had him start drinking pure apple juice which is supposed to soften stones, which he continues to drink. I gave him a cup of cranberry tea each evening as well (he doesn't like cranberry juice) as cranberry is good for the urinary tract. I've known people who've had kidney stones and the bad pain they experience especially when passing them. From all the reviews I've read now on Rowatinex I'm very confident he won't have another attack. I'm going to also purchase their other product for gallstones.I know blood in the urine is not a good sign and can be scary but I read sometimes it's simply just the stones scraping the duct it's passing through. If the blood returns I'll definitely make sure he goes back to the doctor but I'm thinking this product has taken care of the problem. I wish I could say he actually saw a stone that passed but this is our first experience with kidney stones, we're not sure if he'd notice one 'come out', esp. if this product allows them to pass without pain. All I know is he's had no more pain, no more blood in the urine.2022: I just happened across this review I'd written and can't believe I never did update, after taking this as directed, I think it was 2 bottles, the next day after finishing them I heard a yelp from the bathroom, the stone was out, it was long, narrow and rounded on both ends",66 people found this helpful,

Six years ago, I had a stone surgically removed and passed another with alot of pain.  At that time, the doc told me I had other stones in my kidneys.  No problems until this year when they started to slowly move through my system.  Felt low-grade crappy most of the time instead of the excruciating pain I experienced the first time.  I was able to pass one stone of 5mm within a week of taking Rowatinex and then two months later, passed a 6mm, jagged stone within 48 hours of taking it.  When I examined the jagged stone I was amazed -- I don't know how this nasty thing passed without a trip to the ER and with no pain upon exit.  Anyway, I've tried alot of other home remedies (lemon juice, stone breaker formulas) and this worked for me - it seems to me that it softens the stones so that they can be passed.  I will never travel without having these in my purse.  It's worth a try if you suffer from kidney stones -- heck of alot cheaper than surgery.",6 people found this helpful,

The first time I went to the doctor ('93) I found out I had stones in both kidneys, a total of 15 stones altogether. I did the ESWL procedure and had a double ""J"" stint inserted (never again) the first round. A few years later I developed more stones went through the ESWL procedure once again. I had to take a few days off work after that one.Since 1993, I have passed dozens of stones (I have lost track it has been so many), mine are calcium based. I was on an on/off monthly cycle (one month on, one month off) of magnesium which seemed to help for a number of years; this was before I had heard of Rowatinex.At the beginning of 2012 the stones had returned once again, I used a heating pad along with Midol (yes, Midol) and Aleve for the pain. I ran across Rowatinex and read the reviews and thought I would give it a shot. Like the reviews within 24 hours I passed a decent sized stone (not sure of the size but a little smaller than a pea). Within the next two weeks I passed smaller stones but they were mostly sand-like and they all passed with the greatest of ease.My wife ordered the Rowatinex on a Wednesday afternoon and I had them by that Saturday. The pills are round and easy to swallow; you receive two jars each with 50 capsules. During the first day I did notice a camphor smell when burping but only happened once. Yes, the instructions are written in German but there is a small section in English, basically I take 2 capsules three times a day.I love this stuff!

Whenever I am about to pass a stone, It usually starts with blood in the urine and pain in the back from the kidney area and then I can actually feel the stone gradually, slowly and painfully move all through the urinary tract over the course of 2 to 5 days.So in August 2011, I got the initial symptoms of a stone again, and after having passed a huge 7mm stone the previous year (that got stuck, ""OUCH"") I went looking for options, and saw very good reviews about Rowatinex mainly from European and South American sites but not much info from the US; So I ordered it next day delivery and tried it at the dosage listed on the box. The first thing I noticed was the ""camphor"" smelling burps, then an increase in thirst and urination, and that is it for side effects as far as I can tell. After a day of taking the pills, I felt the stone move from the kidney, to the ureter (the tube between the kidney and the bladder) and it got stuck, (so it must have been a big one), a few painful jumping jacks later to help dislodge it, and off to the bladder it went, then I would have expected it's final agonizing travel to the urethra over a few days, but oh surprise, that never happened, after a couple more days of taking the pills it passed as sand which I could barely tell was there, I was very impressed!After it went out, I stopped taking the capsules, so I still had most of them left.Fast forward to December, and here comes a new one, as soon as the symptoms started, I immediately went for the Rowatinex!. Not even 12 hours after the first capsule, and out it went, PAINLESSLY! one thing I noticed is that it made the stone brittle, as opposed to diamond hard as I used to pass before taking Rowatinex.After years of buying stuff on Amazon this is the first review I post, I'm just that impressed and don't even mind that it is selling now for $10 less than when I bought it. I'm just glad Amazon offers it.It really seems that the insurance companies in the US rather have you get ultrasound therapy or surgery as opposed to getting a simple, cheap (it sells for $12 in South America and Europe, and $8 in Cuba) all natural capsule that takes care of the problem.
