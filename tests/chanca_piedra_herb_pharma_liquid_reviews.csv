Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2021",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"THIS WORKS!! I was diagnosed with 4-5 mm kidney stone stuck in my ureter. This is my first time ever  having a kidney stone. My doctor told me it was likely not going to pass because of the size & location but prescribed some medicine & said we could wait it out for a couple of weeks. I prefer natural remedies so decided not to take the prescription. A few days later I had a kidney stone attack & was in so much pain, inflamed, flank pain, running to the toilet literally every 10 min for nothing but dribbles, slight nausea, & I could barely walk so stayed in bed all day. Long story short I made an anti-inflammatory juice shot (ginger root, apple, orange, lemon, tumeric powder, & black pepper). About 30 min later I started feeling better!! The pain, inflammation, & nausea subsided! I wad able to move around & cook dinner. I decided to try the chanca piedra to help in passing the stone. After 3 days of the juice shot 2x/day & the chanca piedra 3x/day my urinary retention cleared! I was no longer dribbling. I was determined to pass the stone naturally so I pushed my follow up appt out to 2 months & for those 2 months this was my daily remedy : 1.) drank 12-16 cups of water daily starting the morning off with 2 cups of warm lemon or lime water, 2.) chanca piedra 3x/ day, & 3.) a cup of ACV water (2 Tbsp unfiltered organic  apple cider vinegar) 5x/day (*1 week on & 1 week off*). I also prayed to God that my stone would not only pass naturally but that it would dissolve so I wouldn’t feel it…and 2 months later I am excited to say my scan results came back clear!! The doctor was SO suprised that it passed! And I never felt any pain when it passed nor did I ever see it (and I checked every time).  All glory to God!!",190 people found this helpful,Size: 4 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)
Warren Keller,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2021",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was in the hospital twice for kidney stones which were protein-based when tested. I gave this a 5-star review because it breaks down that substance in my system and keeps me out of the hospital. Plain and simple. Also, It may sound off color but you need to monitor your urine clarity like the doctors do. That way you can tell it's working by being able to read normal size book print through your urine in an average glass jar when it previously may have been cloudy. This way you can figure out your dosage also. Use it as the manufacturer has instructed and you will get immediate results and notice it 4 hours later. We get UTIs and backups, infections and kidney problems if you don't keep the aperture of the urine system dilated by keeping it clean with products like this. High protein based diets require this usually if your body makes stones from proteins easily like mine. I learned the hard way. It Took me years of pain and suffering emotionally and financially as well while figuring this out. I received traditional kidney stone removal the first time but the second time had to get lithotripsy the  because it was in my ureter and tough to get out. This stuff' cleans you out!

Miss Siren,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2023",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was absolutely floored and terrified when the doctor told me I had a 10 mm kidney stone. A year ago it was 5 mm. Then he told me that it had grown in size and that I would now need surgery. I absolutely did not wanna do surgery but the size of the stone was too big to pass so I thought I would give this product a try. I had only taken  One full bottle which I think lasted me A little over a month. I only took it one to two times a day if I could remember. I was also taking fulvic acid as a friend recommended that to me saying that that dissolved her kidney stone. Honestly I was so scared to take this because I thought if it broke it up in pieces then I would have several stones I would have to pass and I didn’t wanna go through that pain either so I was beyond scared but I thought I’ll do it anyway. Today I went to the hospital for a different reason but they did a kidney scan my 10 mm stone is now only 2 mm. I am blown away I can’t believe it I am so excited and happy . I am going to get another bottle and keep taking it. I’m not sure if it was a combination of both things I was taking or this alone. But literally I only took it for less than two months and that’s how small my stone Got I did not pass any stones or feel any pain. Incredible no surgery needed,61 people found this helpful,Size: 1 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)
SSFlint48,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2020",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"3 or 4 years ago I discovered this product on line with it's many positive reviews.  I also found that I could buy it from the closest Natur-thyme grocery store in Dewitt, NY.  The first time I bought and used a small bottle of it was a month before I was scheduled for a KUB, sonogram and my next urologist appointment.  Mind you, I've had high blood pressure since 1980, and been under doctors' care with a urologist, plus a nephrologist ( 5 years).  I also had lithotripsy twice, which broke up the largest stones somewhat, but that's about all it did.  I've maintained a low oxalate diet, plus 64+ oz. of water with lemon juice, especially since retiring in in 2006.  Nothing was stopping the slow growth of kidney stones or the gradual rise of blood pressure.  Finally, after using this as directed for a month, the tests showed the stones were decreasing.  I never felt anything pass, although for the first time ever I had seen 'gravel' after urinating.  So I've continued taking it sporadically for 3 years.  Since January, Natur-Thyme has been back ordered on this product for several months.  I found it on-line, and am trying to stick to a 15 weeks regime.  I know it works, although I haven't told my urologist.",20 people found this helpful,Size: 4 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)

The doctor handed me pain meds and said ""good luck"". So I purchased this product as part of a desperate attempt to save myself from additional pain.  My overall menu changes included the following plan:- eliminated sodium and oxalates including spinach and nuts which I ate a ton of- lowered calcium, alcohol, and coffee intake as much as humanly possible- stopped taking my normal daily vitamin- added Neeri tablets also purchased on Amazon (3 tablets x3 per day)- drank a ton of lemon juice, lemons in all my water, and eating a ton of watermelon- mixed in apple cider vinegar when I hit my lemon juice max- a kidney cleanse daily tablet (2 tablets x1 per day) used the Health Plus version- doctor prescribed Tamsulosin = Flomax (1 tablet x1 per day)- then this product Chanca Piedra stone breaker (1 stopper full x3 per day)As you can see a lot going on but after 30 days of no pain X-ray showed the stone was still there but re-estimated at 4mm.  Then on day 50 another follow up X-ray showed no stone. The same doctor that said ""good luck"" now all he could say was ""congratulations"". The stone had passed with no additional pain and celebration ensued.

Really Izzy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2020",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,As luck would have it I began having kidney stone pain during the peak of the Corona Virus outbreak in NJ.So needless to say going to the hospital was not an option. When I shared with a co-worker that I was in the midst of passing another stone .. he told me about these Chanca Piedra drops.. Luckily Vitamin Shoppe had them in stock ( alot more expensive) and I began treating myself immediately. One droplet in a bottle of water every hour on the hour. 5 hours later I passed the larger of the stones around 5+ in size. Being that I have always gotten them what surprised me was how round and smooth it was compared to others.So I have remained on this stuff and passed another two plus several small ones. As someone has has even gotten surgery for kidney stones .. I can tell you THIS STUFF WORKS! I now but the 4 ounce bottle here cause it's super cheap! Thanks for this miracle cure .. and sorry for the pic of the stones but as they say seeing is believing !!,53 people found this helpful,Size: 1 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)
