Thrift Schooling,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2016",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This Chanca Piedra works. If you have kidney stones that you need to pass and you don't want to mess with medical procedures then this WILL get them out. Within only ONE WEEK of taking this I started passing stones. After a month I passed four altogether. The first two passed painlessly. The second two, not so painless. It was like passing any other kidney stone, which is worse than childbirth (seriously-it's worse and I just gave birth less than a year ago so I remember the pain well!) I was out of commission for several days until the two stones passed- and they were huge!! I know this works and a renal utrasound shows that I have more stones so I plan on continuing to use this but am waiting for the right time- trying to muster up the strength for the possible pain ahead- but to me- it's worth it to take the natural route so I am thankful for this product.",17 people found this helpful,Size: 120 Count (Pack of 1)
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2017",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"For anyone considering using this to help with kidney stones, I recommend giving it a try before resorting to any more invasive of a treatment. I was diagnosed with a 10 mm kidney stone and scheduled the surgery to have it removed via surgery last June. When I heard that they had to put a stent in, I started exploring options and came upon this product. I cancelled the surgery in the hopes that I would pass the stone. Well, long story short, I did not follow the guidelines on the package and of course nothing seemed to be happening. Fast forward six months and I started experiencing intense pain again, scheduled with the urologist again for the surgery, figuring to just bite the bullet and get it over with, but they scheduled me about three weeks out. Decided to give the Chanca Piedra one more shot in the meantime, this time takiing one in the morning, one after lunch, as directed and LOTS of water. Within one week this time, the stone passed relatively pain free. So, hey, give it a shot, maybe it will save you the surgery too!!!",6 people found this helpful,Size: 120 Count (Pack of 1)
Gotham,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2016",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Was suffering with a kidney stone for 3 days. Did some research and found this stuff. So for 23.00 I figured I had nothing to lose and it was cheaper than a doctor since I am not insured. They came same day ( yesterday ) so I followed the directions and ate something, waited an hour and took the capsule. I felt like crud for 3 whole days, and I knew it was a kidney stone as I had them twice before. I was starting to get very frustrated and wanted this stone out and it was never coming out. About 7-8 hours after my first capsule I went into the bathroom, I did my usual check to see if the stone made an appearance, to my surprise, there it was. I firmly believe this extract helped it to evacuate my body. I would recommend this product to anyone who is suffering with stones. Naturally it also depends on the size, if you have a golf ball sized one, then you will not be able to get it out without medical intervention. So glad I found this stuff, today I feel like me again :)",17 people found this helpful,Size: 120 Count (Pack of 1)
Noah van den Berg,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2016",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"When I read that about the magical herb that they call Stone Crusher, it was hard to believe that something so unknown could really work as well as people were saying. Recently I had my second kidney stone and it was more than double the size of the first at 5 mm. I had been told that it might not pass on its own and would require surgery. After a day of crippling pain as it worked it's way down through my body, it finally stopped moving for a period of time which gave me enough time to do some research about different options.When I stumbled upon Chanca Piedra it just seemed way too good to be true. I ordered it to try it out even though I didn't quite believe the hype because any alternative to surgery was worth a shot. After taking it once daily for 2 weeks, it successfully broke up my stone into smaller pieces and late one evening I was happily surprised to see a large chunk of the stone pass out through my urine without any pain except a small feeling of pressure as it came out. Since then I have seen two other small specks of the stone pass.I couldn't recommend this higher! I've made it part of my daily regiment because I've read that it can even help to keep them from forming or to break them up as they do form. Give it a shot, as one kidney stone sufferer to another, you owe it to yourself to try this out!",33 people found this helpful,Size: 120 Count (Pack of 1)
Zackary M. Riley,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 7, 2017",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this before when I found out I had kidney stones. I started taking it and began drinking water with lemon juice in it. I was pretty sure I passed some stones. When I had an ultrasound later, I had in fact passed some stones. I recently began drinking water with lemon and supplementing/increasing my potassium citrate intake ( 3- 99mg pills with each meal) to help alkalize my body and urine. Well, that has started a rainstorm of stone passing. I do not know if I am passing several small stones or if larger stones are breaking up and passing, but I have been able to collect 3 tiny stones so far. Anyway, since I had taken this Chanca piedra before and seemed to have some luck, I figured I would buy it again to try to clear out the stones I have that are passable. I have one large stone (12mm) that is sitting in a nook in my kidney. It is too large to pass, so I am hoping that increasing the citrate in my urine and taking the Chanca piedra will help whittle the big one down. I do not expect miracles on that stone, but if it shrinks at all I will be happy. In the meantime, I just want the stones that I can feel moving to break up or move along like last time, lol. I am about done feeling bloated and uncomfortable!",12 people found this helpful,
Jan~,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2016",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Here is my story. No one has paid me or even asked me to write this review. In april I ended up in Urgent Care and diagnosed with 4 kidney stones, a 6 mm, 2 mm and a couple 2 and a half mm.These were in both kidneys. Went to one surgeon that acted like I could live with it. Did some research on the internet after being frustrated and in God awful pain.  Bought this and a tea and went to a new surgeon that said he had to do surgery. He knew I was taking this. After surgery he said he couldn't find them. Chanca Piedra must have broke them up.Fast Forward to my 6 week checkup, I have another stone. I had some on the right but the dr. didn't go in to retrieve the right kidney stones. Asked why did I quit taking this. lol Wants to do surgery again. I said give me some time, I am back on this and today I passed a couple grains of sand again. I will NEVER quit taking this ever again. I would rather pay 30 dollars for the capsules as opposed to the surgery. I am still not done. This basically breaks the stones up, you get pieces for days at a time but it's better than the pain and better than surgery.  I highly recommend this, I do drink the tea also.",38 people found this helpful,Size: 120 Count (Pack of 1)
BEA - Devorah,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2016",true,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I went to the doc's and was blasted and nothing happened for weeks. I began using a different Chanco Piedra product and I felt some movement or discomfort of movement. I look around for a stronger or more recommended Chanco Piedra and found Active Naturals. I credit this product with the passing of some of the stone after weeks of not movement. Its unfortunate that the testimonials on Amazon these days are mostly paid for fraudulent testimonies so buyer beware. If you read enough Chanco Piedra product reviews you will see the exact same, word for word, review on almost every distributed product showing us that ratings are coveted and worth paying for. I was not paid... I'm not for sale.But this product seems to be worth a try... hope... I bought some hope and I saw some results while using it. Are the two connected, I don't know but I will continue to use it so long as I keep getting results. I wish I had started directly after the blasting and had not know about this product earlier.",16 people found this helpful,Size: 120 Count (Pack of 1)

Greg,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2015",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This stuff is nothing short of AMAZING!  I had been having HORRIBLE gallbladder attacks, this past year, that were spaced out about a month-at-a-time.  It was like clockwork.  Every month -- around the same day -- I would get these horrible attacks that came and went for about 4-5 days straight.  For anyone that hasn't had them, they feel like a heart attack, and can last for almost 2-4 hours.  Many women say they're more painful than childbirth.  I had been to a few doctors and they all recommended I have my bladder removed.  However, it's still a vital organ, so I really didn't want to go this route.  I thoroughly researched for months-and-months, and my final research led me to this supplement, and it worked!  Last month was the first month I didn't have any gallbladder attacks, and I've been pain free, this month, as well.  I just take 2 per day, and that's it.  I will update when I go to have another ultrasound, but my intuition tells me that the stones are gone.",62 people found this helpful,Size: 120 Count (Pack of 1)
"BE YOURSELF, CAUSE EVERYONE ELSE IS TAKEN!!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2017",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had 4 small stones and now I have NONE!! HOLY MOLY this stuff works. I was having a sharp pain in the morning in my lower back and since I have hd Kidney Stones removed 2 other times.. I know the feeling. My doctor suggested that I consider this as a alternative. The first few weeks I could tell that the pain was decreasing and was using uric acid strips ( I build gout stones- IE uric acid crystals). I usually see my strips at 11 and 12 and was seeing 18 to 21. Pain was reducing and then went in for another set of ultras sound readings and NO STONES!! I had 4 and now NONE. Overall, totally amazed and the doc asked me to send to him the brand. This brand saved me $3,500 and a week off work. THANK YOU!!",30 people found this helpful,Size: 120 Count (Pack of 1)
Surf06,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 27, 2017",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Had a CT-confirmed 4mm kidney stone, treated with Alfuzosin (relaxes prostate and urinary tract like Flomax), with meds for pain if needed.  Had a couple of uncomfortable nights prior to when this CP arrived.  I was also drinking a lot of low-cal lemonade and water.  Started the CP twice a day, had no more pain.  About a week later, urinated out a little blood and passed a few clots, totally painless.  That was about 10 days ago, no symptoms at all since.  Don't know for sure the stone is gone, but it feels like it. Can't tell you for sure about whether this was responsible, or the fluid load, but  I certainly had no side effects noted, so no harm.

Tina J. Bembry,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2020",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of my cats had 3 large bladder stones. The vet put her on prescription food, but didn't suggest anything else. I did a lot of reading and looking at bladder stone formulas for cats and humans, and it seemed the chanca piedra was safe to try as an additional tool to dissolve the stones. In just over a month, the stones were gone! I gave 1/2 a capsule sprinkled onto & mixed into her wet food daily. Some cat formulas use up to 650mg, so I could probably have used more, but this seemed like a good dose to try.",2 people found this helpful,

Adrian,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2016",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,I had a 7 mm stone that my Urologist said would have to be taken out with surgery as it wouldn't probably pass on its own. Had me on Flomax (yuck) for a month and I didn't like the side effects so I stopped taking it. Did some research and I found this brand of Chanca Piedra. Bought 3 bottles....went through the first two (2 caps a day) and almost all of the third one and finally last night the big stone came out. Hooray!! This stuff worked for me and saved me from potential surgery and I can't praise it's effect enough! Now I am NOT a Doctor but give it a try and give it some time to work. It might take more than the 4 months it took for me but don't give up!,34 people found this helpful,Size: 120 Count (Pack of 1)
Bill,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2016",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This stuff is amazing!  I had a 16 mm or 5/8 inch kidney stone.  The untrasonic treatment that cost $53,000.00 didn't touch it.  In 8 days of taking Chanca Piedra ( 3 pills, twice a day )  xrays showed the stone was dissolving and had completely moved out of my kidney.  Over the next two weeks all of it had passed.  Verified with xrays.  And no pain passing any of it.  If you have had stones, you ought to take this once in a while just to make sure you clean them buggers out before they are a problem, because if you had stones once, you will probably have them again.",22 people found this helpful,Size: 120 Count (Pack of 1)

I could feel the 'gravel' moving down to my bladder and out for 4 weeks - not once was it actually painful; never more than a prickly feeling.  I did have two episodes of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) with this, but it is SO worth having healthy kidneys again!  I had purchased another brand before finding the Active Naturals - it smelled like alfalfa, and had several other ingredients in it.  This brand is the real deal - pure herb, and NOTHING else.

Cody,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2017",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,I’ve been trying to pass a kidney stone for going on a week.
