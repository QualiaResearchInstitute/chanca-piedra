Chanca piedra,Activa Naturals Chanca Piedra,William J Gauthier,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2021",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have struggled with kidney stones for a few years. Been to the doc, yada yada, ect, ect.. Tried many things, cutting drinks, foods. Still having stone pain. After taking these. My pain goes away, I haven't noticed any stones leaving, but the pain is gone. Good enough for me. I did ask the doc why I have kidney stones, said I picked bad parents. Brought a smile to me, kinda nice to know, sometimes things are out of our control. I have cut way back on caramel colored sodas, stones grow slower now.",3 people found this helpful,Size: 120 Count (Pack of 1)

Chanca piedra,Activa Naturals Chanca Piedra,Tina J. Bembry,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2020",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"One of my cats had 3 large bladder stones. The vet put her on prescription food, but didn't suggest anything else. I did a lot of reading and looking at bladder stone formulas for cats and humans, and it seemed the chanca piedra was safe to try as an additional tool to dissolve the stones. In just over a month, the stones were gone! I gave 1/2 a capsule sprinkled onto & mixed into her wet food daily. Some cat formulas use up to 650mg, so I could probably have used more, but this seemed like a good dose to try.",2 people found this helpful,

Chanca piedra,Activa Naturals Chanca Piedra,Cody,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2017",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,Iâ€™ve been trying to pass a kidney stone for going on a week.  Took one of these as soon as they arrived and passed my stone in 4 hours.  Iâ€™ve had kidney stones for years and was hospitalized with one too big to pass but the one I just passed was even bigger.  This stuff helps so much with the pain and speeds up the process.  Iâ€™ve taken Chanca Piedra before with good results just a different brand.  I will always purchase this brand in the future.  Soooo worth it!,2 people found this helpful,
