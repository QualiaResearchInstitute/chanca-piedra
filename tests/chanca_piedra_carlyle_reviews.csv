James,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2022",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had Kidney Stones since my early 20's, dealing with them for over 10 years now.  I had surgery twice to remove ones that got stuck.  And I constantly have some in my kidneys.  I haven't had to get surgery recently, but I feel the pain in my kidneys even when many Dr.'s tell me its impossible.  A friend recommended Chanca Piedra.  I've been taking it for about two weeks now and already twice I've passed little pieces of stone. Minimal cramping/pain when passing.  I've taken one a day only, as suggested and it has already been breaking up my stones!",50 people found this helpful,

Nikkie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 10, 2023",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I had been using the liquid version off and on for years when Iâ€™d notice a stone possibly forming. But the stuff tastes like bile or stomach acid. It is so foul. Not sure why I didnâ€™t think to check for s pill version, but glad I found it. So far this brand has done its job well and I plan to take as part of my regular supplements and hopefully prevent future stones.",16 people found this helpful,
Richard B. Matta,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2022",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This came heavily recommended to me by a friend who has had great success with it.  I trusted his word and, being a person who has had about 3 bouts with kidney stones, I just wanted it in my home in my arsenal of medications.  I combine this with D-Mannose as a preventive way to avoid UTI's and kidney stones!  My urologist said he has several patients on D-Mannose!",16 people found this helpful,
