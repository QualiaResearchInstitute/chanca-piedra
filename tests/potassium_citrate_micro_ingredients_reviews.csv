Potassium citrate,Micro Ingredients US Origin Potassium Citrate Powder,Eric C. Anderson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2019",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this to suppress the formation of kidney stones.  I used to take ""prescription"" version in little packets, but that was costing several hundred dollars A MONTH.  I rebelled, and bought this.  Now, it's not in little packets, and it's not ""flavored.""  Big deal.  I use a plastic measuring spoon, and add it to water with some lemon oil and stir.  The lemon oil gives it the flavor (and is also good for kidneys, and many other things), and I use that to take my other medications and vitamins.  Saves a bundle, works just as well.",12 people found this helpful,Flavor Name: Potassium Citrate - ElectrolytesSize: 35 Ounce (Pack of 1)
