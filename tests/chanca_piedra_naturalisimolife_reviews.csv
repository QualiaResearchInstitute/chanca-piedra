When my doctor found 2 kidney stones in my other kidney 8 months later I started researching alternate treatments, and found Chanca Piedra. Given all the glowing reviews, I bought some. My Doctor had me scheduled for outpatient sonic wave procedure to break up my stones so they could pass on their own. I took Chanca tablets 3 times per day for the two weeks prior to the outpatient procedure, and I was sure based on the reviews that they would work. They didn't. They had zero affect on my stones. While in for the sonic procedure, I looked at the live X-ray before going under and saw two, whole, hard as rock stones in my kidney. Chanca did nothing. I wasn't expecting the stones to be gone, but I was expecting to see some evidence of breakup. Nothing. Waste of time and money.

But I had to be honest and give this product  1 star due  to my body's reaction to it.I took it as directed andUnfortunately this  chanca piedra product caused me terrible stomach cramps and diarrhea.I took it on different days and each time it effected me.I stopped taking it yesterday and the diarrhea ceased though stomach is still irritated and having mild discomfort.It is  a shame as I was hoping  this product would help rid my  kidney stone but it caused me side effects badly  enough for me  to discontinue taking it. And so I will have to find something else and continue drinking water to flush it out.  I will put some lemon juice in my water as I hear that may help.It looks like some people can tolerate chanca piedra  and not have gastric upsets but others like myself are sensitive to it.I would caution anyone trying this for the first time to stay close to home and a bathroom  just in case it effects you in the same way as it did me.You certainly do not want to be at work or out on a date or out driving or out  shopping and you get hit with stomach cramps and in urgent need of a bathroom.  That would be rough.You maybe lucky and it'll be fine and it could may even help your kidney stone situation. Who knows.

They made a CT without contrast and they found a 3 mm “something” in the left Ureter, very close to the bladder. Since they ordered the CT without contrast in the emergency room, my urologist is not certain that what I have is a stone or (something else I don’t remember the name).  I Have been taking Flomax along with a higher dose prescribed alieve (pain reliever) for the last 19 days, and also Chancapiedra for the las 18 days. At this point I already scheduled the CT with contrast, because I still have pain and no stone has come out. Maybe I have a type of stone that needs to be treated with another herb, or maybe is not a stone. Time will tell. However, I brother had kidney stones in the past and he treated it with chancapiedra and it worked for him.  Today I started to take a combination of ginger, turmeric and holy basil herbs to substitute the intake of alieve (I don’t want to destroy my stomach with high dosage analgesics) and it is helping with the pain. I am still taking the chancapiedra to see if something comes out before the day of my next CT. I hope this review help others.",4 people found this helpful,

In the beginning, i would get 1 every other year but the past 4 years, i get them like evey few months.  Ive been to a urologist, been on potassium citrate, lowered my sodium, cut back on high oxalate foods, taken 24 hr urine tests.. And before taking this pill, the only thing that kinda helped was taking a good probiotic (there is research that shows that certain strains of probiotics will bind with oxalates and prevent them from binding with calcium to form a stone).  I came across a different brand of chanca peidra back in october and took it for about a month (4 pills daily) but nothing passed (it is now april). Last year at a urologist check up and an ultrasound, i had a 6 mm stone in my right kidney and a 5mm stone on left side.  So that's what led me to try chanca piedra last oct.  Fast forward to first week of april, i started to feel mild back pain and i knew it was the stone moving (but this has been ongoing since feb 2020). So i decided to try this brand of chanca piedra. I received it on apr 14... Took 2 a day for about 5 days.. Then i stopped.. No reason why just forgot to keep taking it. And today is apr 24 and i passed the dark stone (see pic).. Now the only way for me to know for sure if it is the 5mm or 6mm stone is to have an ultrasound or ct or mri.. But I'm willing to bet that it is indeed the 6mm that was in my right side.  For me, i believe these pills helped as i have been trying everything the urologist prescribed for over a year now with no results until this.  I know that stones over 7mm require surgical intervention so I'm glad i didnt have to have it surgically removed (and I've had to have surgery for stone removal as well).",57 people found this helpful,

My PC told me operation or nothing else, if not I might develop cancer and all sorts of things that made me cried, but I refused to be sliced. I carried out so many researches and decided to take my health into my hands. I did the gallbladder flushes, took this supplement and stone free and after some months I could eat everything I couldn't eat.

I still do take this supplement (periodically), and I do the gallbladder flush from time to time ( like once or twice a year).

I heard clinkers hit the bowl. My back has not felt this good for before I hurt my back. Thank you doctors for not thinking this could be an issue. Felt some pain in my right side again the other day took two a the pain subsided. It worked for me and I hope it works for you. Update- I would guess I have used half the bottle 1 at a time when my urine stream gets weak. Anyway been noticing weak stream and felt that twinge in my back and I’m like oh no. So anyway I was bending and doing heavy trailer lifting. Like real heavy and then pain came back and think I pulled muscles in my back… so here is the test I took 2 pills in literally in 1 hour- I got gas and my back pain is almost gone where I can walk again. Wish I owned stock in this company.Ok now we got some serious kidney stone passing. So got the back pain within an hour I was in my bed lying on the side of the pain… it’s what I read you should do. I took two. 1/2 hr pain went I’m like cool. Another half hour my groan hurt like someone was squeezing my -you know- I’m like I gotta go to hospital. I start driving and bam. My junk felt like it was on fire and had to go bathroom. I turned around made to bathroom and excreted the bloodiest brownish mixture I ever seen. Seriously scary… pain went away in 1/2 hr I was back on the job. Two days later for the pain again. Took two. Got a strainer 1/2 hr later caught a 4mm. That other one must have been 8 or bigger cuz I barely felt this one and no blood. I’m sure you’re sick of reading my ramblings. THIS PRODUCT WORKS… absolutely no question.

I’ve had two surgeries in the past on stones and did not want to go through that again.  My first symptom was the flank pain in my back and I knew it was happening again. Ugh.  I waited quite awhile for it to come down in my ureter and then the pain started. Renal colic is the worst!  I landed in the emergency room and was happy to hear it was a 3.5mm stone with two smaller stones still in my left kidney.  I read the reviews on Amazon and have heard of this natural method actually helping people.  So I took the Chanca Pietdra according to bottle instructions and within 7 days, I passed my stone without any drama what’s so ever!  At first, I was feeling tiny particles when i urinated and I didn’t think anything of it.  What actually happens is the Chanca Piedra breaks it down into small sandy particles making it smaller to pass.  I figured that out when i started to strain my urine and one morning PLOP! Out it came!!!  I did it without surgery!!!  Also, a few tablespoons of vinegar water ,and honey helped along with drinking fresh lemon water sped it along.  I still had to take something for the pain when it was in the ureter, but this product helped to make having a kidney stone manageable.  I believe i get kidney stones from taking antihistamines for my allergies s and NOT drinking enough water.  I ordered the Chanca Piedra tea to drink once a day to ward off the evil stones.  Plus, I’m mindful of drinking my tons of water a day with a little fresh lemon juice.  It may take a little time, or not!!!",55 people found this helpful,

I’ve been trying to avoid having it removed. This last time was the worst it has ever been pain wise!! I ordered these hoping the couple comments that mentioned gall bladder were honest reviews. They are amazing!! The pain went away after a half hour or so. I did have to take them a few times the first couple days since the pain would start to come back. But it went right away after taking more.,9 people found this helpful,

A year ago I suffered a horrendous kidney stone. After that, my urine was cloudy and bloody. I was hopeful and excited to start taking Chanca Piedra and am happy to say that since then, my urine is clearer and blood-free! What a relief! Of course I will continue to take it every day.",,
