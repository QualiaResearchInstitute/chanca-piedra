Potassium citrate,"NOW Foods Supplements, Potassium Citrate",MA,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2023",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I take 2 of these every day before a meal. Has absolutely helped reduce my kidney stones. I take them before a salty or sweet meal, although I have seriously had to change to a healthier diet. Before I started these, I was suffering from my eyelids sticking to my eyeballs every morning. I could not open my eyes without using my fingers to carefully pry my lids open. I also had severe hot flashes constantly and felt like I was going to lose it. Basically, I think that I was suffering from really low potassium, and this has helped tremendously. However, when I am eating or drinking anything with calcium or soy (which I try to avoid), I also have to take ""Kidney Cop"" and that has also been a lifesaver and has nixed those awful kidney stones due to calcium. These two must have supplements have also severely reduced the foam in my urine.",55 people found this helpful,Product Packaging: Standard Packaging

It helps with binding to oxalates in plant foods (chocolate, tea, spinach, etc.) to carry them safely out of the body before it can cause kidney stones, back pain or joint pain. For some reason, some people don't deal well with oxalates, so we suffer with pain and kidney stones without realizing we need citrate to help us deal with the oxalate before the body stores it in crystalized formations that cause such terrible pain. Was happy to find this NOW brand at a good price. I take 2-3 with my lunch and it seems to do the trick. No more back pain!",48 people found this helpful,Product Packaging: Standard Packaging

Not having enough magnesium could also cause the problems since it affects the blood potassium level, along with certain metal toxicity (barium, thallium, cesium, etc) interferes with potassium absorption.Potassium citrate is a urinary alkalinizer with an added benefit of preventing kidney stones. Potassium is best taken in food forms (bananas, avocados, greens, beans, etc), but if you tend to overindulge in diuretics such as wine/beer/coffee, be sure to supplement with key minerals, such as magnesium, potassium, iodine, selenium, zinc, etc‚Ä¶ On a related note, if you tend to abuse alcohol and/or insulin resistant, be sure to also look into the insidious and often undiagnosed Thiamine (B1) deficiency which greatly affects glucose metabolism and electrolytes exchange for your nerve and muscle cells.",454 people found this helpful,Product Packaging: Standard Packaging

The only precatuion is that you should never take Potassium Citrate on an empty stomach or with medications/supplements that are hard on the stomach, such as ibuprofen and aspirin. Always take it with food!  If you are unsure about the effects of your meds in combination with Potassium Citrate, go to Drugs.com and use the 'interactions checker"" and you can check your meds and most supplements to see how comapatible they are. Also, If you suffer from GERD, acid reflux of ulcers you should probably talk to your doctor before taking this product since it could aggravate or exacerbate your symptoms.
