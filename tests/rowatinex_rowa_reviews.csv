Rowatinex,Rowatinex by Rowa,Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2022",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Unfortunately, I started taking indapamide at the same time I started taking the rowatinex so it is possible that the indapamide has made the big difference but I don't think so. I think it is maybe a combo of the two or the rowatinex making the bigger difference of the two. I was taking lasik and the dr changed to indapamide instead to help not get kidney stones.When starting I had 5 stones in each kidney  biggest being 9mm. After a year taking 3 rowatinex twice a day and the indapamide, I went for exam and I had none in left kidney and several in right all 5mm or less. I have had totally different readings within a week of each other so it is alway hard to trust the competence of technicians. The 2nd year I went in and only had some tiny tiny stones. I decreased my rowitinex to 2 twice a day because it seemed alot I was taking and it is expensive. 3rd year, I was hoping for no sign of stones but there were several in right and one is 6mm. Did decrease in what I was taking in rowatinex make that difference? Not sure on that.My conclusion is that it must be helping, but it is not an instant acting fix for while you are passing a stone. Over the last 3 years I have had kidney stone pain and I chug water while constantly walking and pacing. The stone usually passed or subsided within an hour of doing this. Before starting  on rowatinex, I was having to have lithotripsy every 6 months to a year.I could stop taking it and only take the indapamide to test this but I don't want to risk getting enormous stones i can't pass to test this theory. Right now I will continue with regimen.I heard about rowatinex because a friend was in Germany and passed a stone and the hospital gave her the rowatinex to prevent stones. Dr.s I have went to have not heard of it, or don't acknowledge it because studies haven't been done to validate it in U.S.",3 people found this helpful,

Everything is different...language, doctors, processes, labs etc.So, I had left the US for about a year and settled in nicely until one day the pain in my groin, back and stomach just rolled on in like an announced guest.No bueno.Went to the local Farmacia and grabbed some ibuprofen and it helped slightly. Two weeks later I'm still in pain, burning etc. and generally thinking I have an std. Ugh.Well, let's get it over with then right? Headed to the hospital and had the embarrassment of telling them the dreaded statement...""it burns when I pee"".Yea, good times.They make me wait an hour or so and then send me to the lab. They take the blood work and send me over to the Urologist. Of course by now I'm dreading the results and then the doc looks up from the paperwork and says everything looks pretty good. I'm like huh?He said in Spanish I have stones. Ahhhhh phew! Relief it was. The ultrasound showed 3 stones and he said maybe head over to get an MRI to check the rest. At least my kidneys looked good, but that didn't stop the pain.The doc sends me out the door with a script for Ketorolac and Rowatinex. I had never heard of either before now.I picked up the pastillas and headed home. Not even 24 hours later I felt relief. Maybe a fluke right?Took the Ketorolac for only 5 days(apparently it's no bueno after that) and the Rowatinex for 2 weeks.I can't tell if one passed or not, but I felt Great!!!Fast forward to a few months later and I started to get that redness and burning again. Went to the Farmacia and knew to grab the Rowatinex and no script was needed. One day later I felt relief again and have been taking 3-4 a day ever since. I'll also add that erections are better and ejaculate has a lot more volume now.Interesting side effect...Take one before every meal and live again without worrying about stones :)",One person found this helpful,

It seems to run in our family.  Apparently, my family has a problem with calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate or a combo of the two.  I have spent many miserable days and nights at the local ER because of them.  Now, with so much pain med abuse, the ER's are reluctant to prescribe or give you anything heavy duty that works on the pain.  When you have recurring stones, you start getting a little desperate.  I keep an old bottle of Percocet in my night stand, as I am paranoid about having to suffer through another excruciating bout with these things.  My last attack a few years ago was unbearable and the ER doc wanted to fob me off with Ultram!  I had one kidney stone that was stuck in the bend of my ureter and according to the CT scan, I also had a total of four more stones in my kidneys (two in each).I started researching to see if there was anything out there that could possibly help, besides just diet modification.  I found out about Rowatinex and started taking it.  Knock on wood, I haven't had any more attacks.  I have no idea if the stones passed or not, as nothing ever showed in the strainer.  All I know is the pain eventually subsided and I felt better after taking the Rowatinex.  The instructions say you can take two pills up to three times daily.  I take two or three capsules every night before bedtime now, just as a preventative and haven't had any problems since.  I am thankful to have found this formula!

I had a 7x6x4mm stone stuck at the very bottom of my ureter.  I live in the middle of nowhere in the mountains of Guatemala, and the quality of medical care here is iffy at best.  It took them three months to even figure out what was wrong with me, but finally they got a good, clear scan and someone who could read it.  The doctor told me that since the ureter narrows at the junction with the bladder, it was highly unlikely I would ever pass this stone and was doing damage to my kidney by leaving it there.  He wanted to do a ureteroscopy, remove the stone, and put in a stent.  I'd heard awful things about those stents and wasn't too thrilled to get such an invasive procedure done down here in the boonies, so I put him off for weeks.  I heard about Rowatinex from a pharmacist here and decided to stop taking the Flomax (made me dizzy) and try this instead.  I took 2 pills Sunday night, 2 pills 3x on Monday, and passed the stone this morning before I even had a chance to take the pills.  Best part is that I passed it with zero pain!

From what I have seen myself, Rowatinex helps reduce the pain of passing stones and helps the body make softer ""matrix-type"" stones that are easier to pass.  I am a chemist, and I have read the literature about this medication.  The proposed chemistry for how these pills work makes chemical sense.  If you form calcium oxalate-type stones, this medication should make the calcium more soluble in your urine, and greater solubility means less calcium oxalate stone formation and likely softer ""matrix-type"" stones, if stones do form.",25 people found this helpful,

Since I'm the family vet tech, I took the little girl everywhere for assessment and suggestions. Diet, medicine, water changes...nothing worked very well and the stones would periodically recur.

The lady suggested this product. Since then, the little dog has had significantly decreased recurrence of crystals in her urine. Important: this product hasn't removed the urinary troubles completely, but it has worked in addition to all the other things we do for her (diet, low Ph water, occasional treatment) to keep the stones from actually forming. It DOES appear to be a useful supplement, but like anything else, I do not believe it is a miracle cure, and I do not know if drinking cranberry daily would have the same effect. However, you try to get a dog to drink cranberry juice (or me, for that matter)! This thing has worked as well as expected, and a bit better. Now, in all fairness, it works for a dog.

Rowatinex,Rowatinex by Rowa,Bo,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2013",true,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Severe pain sent me to ER. Started drinking more fluid, including lemonade juice + olive oil and apple cider vinegar with water, and taking Flomax. Ordered Rowatinex 10 days after stone was found, 2 pills x 3 daily. Passed the stone 26 days after stone was found, or 17 days after taking Rowatinex.The stone caught was the same size as the original size detected by CT scan. So Rowatinex apparently did not dissolve the stone. Did it help with passing my stone? I am not 100% sure. A lot of people with painful kidney stones started to drink a lot of fluid while on Rowatinex. Thus, it is difficult to attribute the successful passing of the stone entirely to Rowatinex, at the least.Maybe, Rowatinex is helpful more on prevention, rather than on treating already-formed kidney stones. Good luck to those who suffer from the pains of having a kidney stone.",5 people found this helpful,

While skeptical at first, the Amazon reviews helped make my decision easier. If it worked it would be a lot cheaper than having Lithotripsy.I placed the order Sunday afternoon after leaving the ER and received the package in Wednesday's mail.The first few days I took Flomax and Vicodin to keep the pain in check.

Rowatinex,Rowatinex by Rowa,rose,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2013",true,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My husband went to the doctor after what seemed like a kidney stone attack. The doctor said he had a kidney infection and some blood in his urine. He took antibiotics for 10 days, but still we saw blood in his urine. On the tenth day he had another more minor attack of pain. During this time, since I've always believed in natural cures, I started looking on Amazon for products to get rid of stones.I found 'stone blasters' with good reviews, but reviewers often said the pain of passing the stones would still be there regardless. Then I saw the Rowatinex reviews and noticed instead reviewers saying stones passed without pain, that they either became very soft or broke apart. I looked into the product some more online and only found good reviews, no bad ones, with no side effects, so this is the one I ordered. Since people used it for eliminating stones but also for prevention of stones, I'll be taking them as well, and also keep some on hand.After a day of taking the Rowatinex my husband was no longer passing blood, he's just finishing his first bottle (2 bottles in the box). I read online he should take them for a month, he's been on 2 three times a day. He hasn't had any more pain, blood, or problems since starting them.Amazon products always come quickly, within a few days, so while waiting I had him start drinking pure apple juice which is supposed to soften stones, which he continues to drink. I gave him a cup of cranberry tea each evening as well (he doesn't like cranberry juice) as cranberry is good for the urinary tract. I've known people who've had kidney stones and the bad pain they experience especially when passing them. From all the reviews I've read now on Rowatinex I'm very confident he won't have another attack. I'm going to also purchase their other product for gallstones.I know blood in the urine is not a good sign and can be scary but I read sometimes it's simply just the stones scraping the duct it's passing through. If the blood returns I'll definitely make sure he goes back to the doctor but I'm thinking this product has taken care of the problem. I wish I could say he actually saw a stone that passed but this is our first experience with kidney stones, we're not sure if he'd notice one 'come out', esp. if this product allows them to pass without pain. All I know is he's had no more pain, no more blood in the urine.2022: I just happened across this review I'd written and can't believe I never did update, after taking this as directed, I think it was 2 bottles, the next day after finishing them I heard a yelp from the bathroom, the stone was out, it was long, narrow and rounded on both ends",66 people found this helpful,

Six years ago, I had a stone surgically removed and passed another with alot of pain.  At that time, the doc told me I had other stones in my kidneys.  No problems until this year when they started to slowly move through my system.  Felt low-grade crappy most of the time instead of the excruciating pain I experienced the first time.  I was able to pass one stone of 5mm within a week of taking Rowatinex and then two months later, passed a 6mm, jagged stone within 48 hours of taking it.  When I examined the jagged stone I was amazed -- I don't know how this nasty thing passed without a trip to the ER and with no pain upon exit.  Anyway, I've tried alot of other home remedies (lemon juice, stone breaker formulas) and this worked for me - it seems to me that it softens the stones so that they can be passed.  I will never travel without having these in my purse.  It's worth a try if you suffer from kidney stones -- heck of alot cheaper than surgery.",6 people found this helpful,

The first time I went to the doctor ('93) I found out I had stones in both kidneys, a total of 15 stones altogether. I did the ESWL procedure and had a double ""J"" stint inserted (never again) the first round. A few years later I developed more stones went through the ESWL procedure once again. I had to take a few days off work after that one.Since 1993, I have passed dozens of stones (I have lost track it has been so many), mine are calcium based. I was on an on/off monthly cycle (one month on, one month off) of magnesium which seemed to help for a number of years; this was before I had heard of Rowatinex.At the beginning of 2012 the stones had returned once again, I used a heating pad along with Midol (yes, Midol) and Aleve for the pain. I ran across Rowatinex and read the reviews and thought I would give it a shot. Like the reviews within 24 hours I passed a decent sized stone (not sure of the size but a little smaller than a pea). Within the next two weeks I passed smaller stones but they were mostly sand-like and they all passed with the greatest of ease.My wife ordered the Rowatinex on a Wednesday afternoon and I had them by that Saturday. The pills are round and easy to swallow; you receive two jars each with 50 capsules. During the first day I did notice a camphor smell when burping but only happened once. Yes, the instructions are written in German but there is a small section in English, basically I take 2 capsules three times a day.I love this stuff! It is much cheaper and less painful than paying for the ESWL surgery. Worked well for me.",10 people found this helpful,

Whenever I am about to pass a stone, It usually starts with blood in the urine and pain in the back from the kidney area and then I can actually feel the stone gradually, slowly and painfully move all through the urinary tract over the course of 2 to 5 days.So in August 2011, I got the initial symptoms of a stone again, and after having passed a huge 7mm stone the previous year (that got stuck, ""OUCH"") I went looking for options, and saw very good reviews about Rowatinex mainly from European and South American sites but not much info from the US; So I ordered it next day delivery and tried it at the dosage listed on the box. The first thing I noticed was the ""camphor"" smelling burps, then an increase in thirst and urination, and that is it for side effects as far as I can tell. After a day of taking the pills, I felt the stone move from the kidney, to the ureter (the tube between the kidney and the bladder) and it got stuck, (so it must have been a big one), a few painful jumping jacks later to help dislodge it, and off to the bladder it went, then I would have expected it's final agonizing travel to the urethra over a few days, but oh surprise, that never happened, after a couple more days of taking the pills it passed as sand which I could barely tell was there, I was very impressed!After it went out, I stopped taking the capsules, so I still had most of them left.Fast forward to December, and here comes a new one, as soon as the symptoms started, I immediately went for the Rowatinex!. Not even 12 hours after the first capsule, and out it went, PAINLESSLY! one thing I noticed is that it made the stone brittle, as opposed to diamond hard as I used to pass before taking Rowatinex.After years of buying stuff on Amazon this is the first review I post, I'm just that impressed and don't even mind that it is selling now for $10 less than when I bought it. I'm just glad Amazon offers it.It really seems that the insurance companies in the US rather have you get ultrasound therapy or surgery as opposed to getting a simple, cheap (it sells for $12 in South America and Europe, and $8 in Cuba) all natural capsule that takes care of the problem.
